This directory contains the low level view and support classes.
They are compiled by stc into the library 'libview'.
These classes provide the minimum support for any application with graphical
user interface - however, some stuff has been moved into an extra directory
(libview2). Now, all medium level interfacing (mostly Model support, Layout
and Imagereaders) is found there. This allows for simple applications 
(which do not need models but instead use the old action-block schemes)
to be linked without libview2.

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is one of:

	libview.a      - an archive
	libview.olb    - an archive (vms)

	libview.obj    - a prelinked object library

	libview.so     - a shared object
	libview.dll    - a shared object (windows)

the library includes init code (libview_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libview

    make objs           compile all required object files

    make install        compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall       only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date 

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate
