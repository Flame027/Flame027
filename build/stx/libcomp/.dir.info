This directory contains the bytecode compiler classes. 
These classes are needed for incremental compilation and
for evaluation of expressions from strings.
They are compiled by stc into the library 'libcomp'.

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

        libcomp.a      - an archive

        libcomp.obj    - a prelinked object library

        libcomp.so     - a shared object

the library includes init code (libcomp_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libcomp

    make objs           compile all required object files

    make install        compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall       only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date 

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate

    make clean

    make clobber
