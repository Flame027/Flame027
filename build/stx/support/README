This directory contains additional libraries
and useful support stuff - some of which has not
yet been (fully) integrated into the ST/X system.
The following are (currently) used:

    libjpeg	- req'd for the JPEGImageReader class
		  in $(TOP)/libview2.

    libdld	- dynamic object loader for old a.out
		  systems (no longer required on modern
		  systems). Req'd for linux-a.out,
		  sun3 (68k) and sun4 (pre-solaris) versions.

    MESA	- OpenGL compatible 3D graphics
		  Req'd by the OpenGLDevice class in
		  $(TOP)/libopengl.

    VGL		- GL subset-compatible 3D graphics
		  Req'd by the GLXWorkstation class
		  in $(TOP)/libview.
		  Will be obsoleted by libopengl.
