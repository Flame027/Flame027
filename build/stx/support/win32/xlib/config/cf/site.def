 *                                                                         *
 *			   SITE-SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS                       *
 *                                                                         *
 * This file contains two halves, one included before the vendor-specific  *
 * configuration file (.cf file), and one included after the .cf file.     *
 * The before-half should be protected by #ifdef BeforeVendorCF, and the   *
 * after-half should be protected by #ifdef AfterVendorCF.                 *
 *                                                                         *
 * The before-half should only set things that the .cf file depends on.    *
 * For the .cf files shipped in this release, the main variables in this   *
 * category are HasGcc, HasGcc2, and HasCplusplus 			   *
 *                                                                         *
 * The after-half should contain all other definitions.  For example,      *
 * place your ProjectRoot definition here.                                 *
 *                                                                         *
 * OS Major and Minor version numbers should be changed directly in the    *
 * .cf file, not overridden in site.def.                                   *
 *                                                                         *
