I use your ctags here at work, and wanted to thank you for writing such a nice
software package.  I like it so much more than the normal ctags program....
Thank you so much for writing such a great package!

I am just glad that such great software is avaiable out there.  Most ctags on
Unix simply blow chunks!  Yours is absoulutely fantastic and has saved me
numerous hours of wasted time. I have even managed to get the project
managament here to make it sort of a standard, though it had to be installed
as vtags so it would not confuse the curmudgeons still using the broken ctags
that comes with the system.  When used with vim, it works absolutely
fantastic.  I hope I am not gushing here. :)

Exuberant Ctags is a great tool indeed!

In better news, I'm trying to convert all the developers here (30+) to use 
ctags-3.0. Just finding enumeration fields will probably be enough for any of 
us to switch!

23 Oct 1998
First off, I would like to thank you for creating Exuberant Ctags.  This 
program completely kicks ass, if you'll pardon me for saying so.  :)

Well done on producing a very decent version of ctags. I use it at work and at
home and find it very useful for navigating moderately sized projects. Thanks!

Thanks for Exuberant Ctags - it is quite an improvement over ctags,
even gnu ctags.

I just spent the last few days integrating your Ctags program into our
build environment here.  On NT, Visual C++'s browse files don't work
because our project is too large.  So, I wrote a plug-in for Visual Studio
to use a tags file instead.  We are traditionally a Unix house and use tags
elsewhere.  Anyway, Ctags goes through our source in about 8 minutes and
generates a 20meg+ tags file (with lots of options turned off).  That's
pretty impressive speed and thoroughness.

Thanks a lot for creating a great tool!

Your ctags program is extremely useful and a key part of my development
environment.  Thank you for writing it. I'm sure it will live a loooong life.

---------------
26 Aug 1998
Thanks for your great piece of software.  It has saved me the headache of
creating my own little C++ parser for a Microsoft Visual Studio addin I was
writing.

24 Aug 1998
I love your ctags program and I've gotten all my co-workers to love it too.

Just to add my voice to the chorus of happy exuberant ctags
users: it's just great.

I am using your ctags for Java -- & it's is a great convenience! 
...This really is a great help for working in Java.

Brilliant brilliant brilliant, thanks very much... Now a truly indispensable
piece of software. Thanks for the perfect companion for Vim.

Again, ec21 is great, especially the C++ support.  Keep up the good work.

02 Jul 1998
You did an excellent job in producing this product, and you deserve *much*
thanks for it.

---------------
01 Jul 1998
...the best ctags program in the world!

15 Jun 1998
Great product!  I'm trying to get others in my group to use this with vim.

---------------
14 May 1998
First of all, let me congratulate you on the terrific 2.0 release of 
ctags with C++ support.

---------------
05 May 1998
I love the program.  It has the process of "figuring out" code much easier.

---------------
03 May 1998
I have just completed the task of changing Zeus [Win95 editor] to
support for your new tag file format and I have to say that I am very
impressed with your ctags.exe program. In fact it is just amazing!

I would like to congradulate you on your implementation of Exuberant Ctags.

I have added master tag files for everything in /usr/include and I have
a cron job to build master tag files for the linux kernel(which makes for 
highly productive hack sessions when you have nearly the entire kernel
at your fingertips). I often wonder how I got along for so many years 
without it! In fact, I have converted users of the dreaded Microsoft(tm)
MSDEV(tm) IDE(probably a TM here too) to VIM-5.0 for NT(tm) along with
your implmentation of ctags because it was easier for them to navigate
around the code!

Now, whenever I use a ctags that isn't yours, I feel crippled in my ability
to write good code quickly. I love your enhancments to it.

Please keep up the good work! The world needs people like you. 

[And later...]

I love the fact that if one really hates some piece of software, they
can get third party stuff written by people like you that are ten times
better than the original product.
...Anyway. Once again, I thank you for writing such a valuable piece
of art, and that is really what it is.

12 Mar 1998
I just wanted to let you know that I have been looking for a program
just like ctags.... Definitely a service to the programming community!

---------------
23 Jan 1998
Thank you very much for writing Exuberant Ctags. It has been extremely
useful!

04 Jan 1998
I'm another enthusiastic fan of your exuberant ctags package; nice work! 
I use it to streamline all of my C programming.  I'm addicted ;-). 

---------------
03 Dec 1997
I just want to let you know that I really like your version of ctags.
I downloaded it about 6 months ago (probably need to update my copy)
and have been using it alot.
Thanks for the good work!

12 Sep 1997
I love your ctags program and have used it for about a year now and think the
additions are great.

---------------
06 Jul 1997
I've made heavy use of your Exuberant Ctags program this spring for my
Software Engineering and Data Structures courses at school -- coupled with
VIM this is a truly fantastic combo that saved my... er, *gluteus m.* on
several occasions!  Thanks SO much for a truly great program.

Subject: exuberant ctags rocks!

...gnu ctags didn't know squat about variables, structures, enums... etc.

After doing a search on the web for 'ctags' I found your extended ctags.
What a lifesaver.  This thing does almost everything a person could ask for.

It rocks, it rocks, it rocks.

Hello.  One of my users told me about your ctags package.  They tell me
its great stuff.

---------------
27 Mar 1997
I've just begun using your ctags program and it is indeed wonderful!

---------------
19 Feb 1997
Wow!

I've been a vi/vim/ctags user for about 12 years now. Most of
those 12 years I've been frustrated by various tags generators and
wished someone would combine all the different features into a single
program. And have it work. I've never found the time/energy to tackle
that one (I've tackled enough other extracurricular programming). But,
now you've done it! And in a big way!

Hats off, I bow to you and send many grateful thanks.

main() { int i; for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("WOWWOW\n");}

Your new ctags is very very excellent.  Usually if I want to
insert the enum'ed variable into tags file, I always had to
"grep/awk/grep/awk/grep/awk/", then ":%!sort" in vi...
a lot of trouble to me.  Furthermore, it can give me all the global
variables, how excellent your package is!  And another thing.. is
If a source file is something like this,
    typedef void (*func_t)(const char **b, int c);
Then other ctags gives me a very very strange results to me, on the
contrary your ctags gives me exact results.

I only downloaded your package about 2 hours ago, so there must be a lot
of new improvement that I didn't find out yet.

Thank you

...your ctags and your advice have and will save me countless hours hunting
down defines, functions, etc. Koodos for the effort and keep up the good
work.

---------------
06 Aug 1996
I've downloaded your ctags- it is great!!!  I have been pulling my hair
out trying to figure out how to do some of this.  The macros and extern'ed
functions are very, very helpful.  Also, I'd like to complement your on
your coding style: very consistent and fairly easy to read.  It definitely
shows when a software developer feels pride in their work.

---------------
29 May 1996
I use `ctags' on ugly source codes thus your version is very helpful.
Thank you!

My initial impression (after 5 minutes use) is that it works better than
the solaris ctags. Excellent tool!

02 Apr 1996
First let me thank you for the ctags program. It handles finding of tags
better than every other ctags I've used so far.
[Germany]

---------------
02 Apr 1996
Wow!  I've just tried this out, and despite being the very first beta
release of this program, it already seems to be the best ctags program
I've seen.  Up to now I have been using the ctags that came with elvis,
and I've just compared the output "tags" files.

The elvis ctags had lots of little tags for things that shouldn't have had
tags (e.g. "if", "return", "TRUE", etc.), but this new ctags doesn't produce
tags for those.  It does find several tags though that the elvis ctags could
not (e.g. "insstr" in the vim code!).

[And later...]

Wow!  All the bugs I reported last time have been fixed :-)  It does
indeed seem very robust now.  Well done!
[Australia]
