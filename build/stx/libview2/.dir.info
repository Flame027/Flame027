This directory contains additional medium level view support classes. 
Mostly, these are things related to Models, Images and ST-80 compatibility.

They are compiled by stc into the library 'libview2'.
These classes are required for the development system and most high level
widget classes.
Small programs may be built without this library, if no models are used.

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

	libview2.a      - an archive

	libview2.obj    - a prelinked object library

	libview2.so     - a shared object

the library includes init code (libview2_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libview

    make objs           compile all required object files

    make install        compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall       only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date 

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate


To install them as autoloaded (in the running image):

    make mf
    make updAbbrev
    rdoit "Smalltalk installAutoloadClasses"
