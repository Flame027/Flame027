This directory contains resource files for the widgets.

The widget classes get their strings from these resource files.
These files are only read during startup or when the language is changed.

Notice: starting with ST/X vsn 5.5.1, all resource strings are being
	concentrated into a single catalog (libview/resources/<lang>.rs)
