# This file is (currently) only used with win-95 / win-NT versions of STX.
# It lists the dll's which are to be loaded at startup time.
# Notice, lines starting with a "#" are comments.
# Lines starting with a "*" are treated as comments by the VM, but are usually loaded
# by the application at the very beginning.
#
# All classes loaded at startup time will be present as precompiled classes.
# Others might be autoloaded or loaded explicit using "Smalltalk loadPackage:xxx".
