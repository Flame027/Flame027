The contents of this directory is generated automatically.
DO NOT MANUALLY MODIFY THE DIRECTORY OR THE FILES.

This directory contains "symbolic links" to compiled
class libraries which can be conveniently loaded via the
launcher's "Load Package" dialog.

These links are generated and collected by the makefiles,
as packages are compiled.

There is no real new semantic functionality here;
however, collecting the links allows for a much faster package load
dialog (without it, a slow recursive directory search would be needed)
