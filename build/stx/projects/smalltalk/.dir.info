This is the directory where your smalltalk executable is created.
The TOP makefile arrives here and does a 'make' here as
a final step.
The make here will leave an executable 'smalltalk' here.
This can be executed here or copied to use/local/bin (or whereever).
For proper execution, smalltalk needs access to the sourcefiles (for the browser)
and some config files (resources, styles and .rc files).
The makefile here creates subdirectories containing symbolic links to
these files. The searchpath (see Smalltalk>>systemPath) for all file accesses
is set to access files either locally, or in usr/local/lib/smalltalk.
Local operation:
	files are installed as symbolic links in subdirectories.
	The are accessed locally ('.' being in the path)
Group operation (proper installation):
	the files are installed as copies subdirs of in usr/local/lib/smalltalk
	Users may override these by creating subdirectories locally
	(for example: having a private 'smalltalk.rc')
	Access is from local files or global files - whichever is found first


Things you can do here:

    make                compile a smalltalk, create symbolic links to
			sourcefiles, bitmaps and resources.
			The resulting executable (stx) is fit for local
			execution (i.e. it does not require any installed
			files from other places).
			It can also be installed for shared usage (in /usr/local)
			via the INSTALL script found in the TO directory.

    make smalltalk      only compile; leave links alone

    make smalltalk ADDITIONAL_CLASSES=<list of class names> \
		   ADDITIONAL_OBJS=<list of object files>

			compile (i.e. link) a smalltalk, which contains
			additional user classes.
			This can be used to make a bigger smalltalk, without
			defining a PACK.
			However, we recommend adding a package definition to the
			configurations/PACKS directory, and doing a CONFIG.

    make stx_fullstatic
			generates a statically linked executable.
			On some systems (solaris), this has a much faster
			startup time, since the shared-library linker does not have
			to patch the executable during startup (which creates lots of
			copy-on-write actions).

    make symLinks       only symbolic links are created

    make install        install smalltalk, libraries, include-files
			and sources in DESTBINDIR and DESTLIBDIR.
			Check with 'make -n install' before doing so.
			DESTBINDIR/DESTLIBDIR are typically set to
				/usr/local/bin
				/usr/local/lib/smalltalk
			respectively.

    make demoApp1       a 'hello world' non-graphical demo application
