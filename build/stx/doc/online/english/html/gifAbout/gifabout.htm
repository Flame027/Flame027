  Understanding GIF89A
</H3>
<P>
First, a little legal mumbo-jumbo that has upset a lot of people. The GIF
image format uses a built-in LZW compression algorithm. This compression
algorithm is patented technology and currently owned by Unisys Corporation.
As of 1995, Unisys decided that commercial vendors, whose products use the
GIF LZW compression, must license its use from UNISYS. End users, online
services, and non-profit organizations do not pay this royalty. Since it's
inception GIF has been a royalty-free format. Only as of 1995, did Unisys
decide to collect royalties. To avoid this royalty, vendors have developed
an alternative to GIF that supports transparency and interlacing called PNG
("ping"), the Portable Network Graphic. PNG, however, does not support a
multiple image data stream to my knowledge.
<P>
Now, to clean up some of the mess I've made. I still have to find specifications
for GIF87a to be sure of everything, but this is how I understand it. GIF87a
was released...guess when? 1987. GI87a allowed for the following features
<UL>
  <LI>
    LZW compressed images
  <LI>
    multiple images encoded within a single files
  <LI>
    positioning of the images on a logical screen area <I>(need to confirm this
    fact)</I>
  <LI>
    interlacing <I>(need to confirm this fact)</I>
</UL>
<P>
This means that nine years ago, it was possible to do simple animation with
GIFs by encoding multiple images, what we will refer to as "frames", in a
single file. GIF89a is an extension of the 87a spec. GIF89a added:
<UL>
  <LI>
    how many 100ths of a second to wait before displaying the next frame
  <LI>
    wait for user input
  <LI>
    specify transparent color
  <LI>
    include unprintable comments
  <LI>
    display lines of text
  <LI>
    indicate how the frame should be removed after it has been displayed
  <LI>
    application-specific extensions encoded inside the file
</UL>
<P>
Netscape Navigator is the only browser than comes close to full GIF89a
compliance. The lines of text &amp; user input are not currently supported
in NEtscape Navigator 2.0, and the image removal doesn't support <I>removal
by previous image</I>. Most browsers support single image GIF87a and will
recognize the transparency flag of GIF89a and nothing else. I received numerous
corrections stating that all transparent GIFs are GIF89a format. I realize
this. Several people thought it confusing to call this GIF89a animation when
GIF87a could accommodate some of these animations. I guess the technically
accurate naming convention would be <I>"mostly GIF89a-compliant animations
which take advantage of some or all of the GIF89a-compliant features present
in Netscape Navigator and hopefully other browsers, though some browsers
technically support GIF87a animation with selective support of GIF89a
transparency and everything else of GIF89a ignored.</I>" I will continue
to call it GIF89a animation.
<P>
GIF89a is still a 256-color (maximum) format. GIF allows for any number of
colors between 2 and 256. The fewer colors the less data and the smaller
the graphic files. If your GIF only uses 4 colors, you can reduce the palette
to only 2 bits (4 color) and decrease the file size by upwards of 75%.
<P>
<B>The following software lets you set bits-per-pixel for GIFs:</B> Abode
Photoshop(Mac/Win), Boxtop's PhotoGIF PlugIn(MAC), GIFConvertor(Mac), and

<H4>
  The Structure of a GIF89a file
</H4>
<P>
This is a little technical but it will give users a real understanding of
how the GIF works, and what you need to do with it. GIFs are composed of
<I>Blocks</I> and <I>Extensions</I>. Blocks can be classified into three
groups:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Control
  <LI>
    Graphic-Rendering
  <LI>
    Special Purpose
</UL>
<P>
Control blocks, such as the Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, the Graphic
Control Extension and the Trailer, control how the graphic data is handled.
Graphic-Rendering blocks such as the Image Descriptor and the Plain Text
Extension contain data used to render a graphic . Special Purpose blocks
such as the Comment Extension and the Application Extension are not used
by GIF decoders at all. The Logical Screen Descriptor and the Global Color
Table affect all the images in a single file. Each Control block will only
affect a single Image block that immediately follows it.
<P>
Here's what a GIF looks like inside:
<H4>
  GIF89a File Structure
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>
    GIF89a HEADER
  <LI>
    LOGICAL SCREEN DESCRIPTOR BLOCK
    <UL>
      <LI>
	may include an optional GLOBAL COLOR TABLE (99.5% of the time this will be
	present)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    optional NETSCAPE APPLICATION EXTENSION BLOCK(:-&gt; surprise)
  <LI>
    a stream of graphics (each graphic being composed of the following)
    <UL>
      <LI>
	an optional GRAPHIC CONTROL BLOCK (one preceding each IMAGE)
      <LI>
	a single IMAGE DESCRIPTOR or PLAIN TEXT BLOCK
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    which can include an optional LOCAL COLOR TABLE for an image
	  <LI>
	    and the actual IMAGE or TEXT data table
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    GIF TRAILER ends the series of images
</UL>
<P>
COMMENT BLOCKS may appear anywhere as they are ignored. (Do NOT place them
before the Netscape Looping Extension!!) 
  <HR>
<H3>
  BLOCK DEFINITIONS:
</H3>
<H4>
  HEADER
</H4>
<P>
The HEADER block is a small 6-byte (6-character) block. It is the first block
in every file and contains the GIF version of the file (i.e either GIF87a
or GIF89a). GIF image decoders use this information to determine the version
of the file.
<H4>
  LOGICAL SCREEN DESCRIPTOR
</H4>
<P>
The LOGICAL SCREEN DESCRIPTOR is always the second block in a file. It defines
an area of pixels which you can think of as a screen (like a projector screen).
The dimensions of this area define the size of your GIF on screen. This
information determines how much space is reserved on-screen in your browser
to display the image. If your logical screen is larger than your image, you
will have space around the image when displayed.
<P>
The logical screen area should be large enough to display all of your individual
frames in it. If an image in the GIF file is larger than the logical screen
or, by its positioning, extends beyond the screen, the portion that is off-screen
will not be displayed. Think of it the way a movie that is too big would
not fit on a projector screen. More importantly,
<IMG SRC="bug.gif" ALIGN=left WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=43>Netscape Beta4 (possibly
more) will <FONT COLOR="RED">GPF (General Protection Fault) in Windows
3.x</FONT> on an image larger than the Logical Screen Header. Do not assume
all of your images are the same size. Read through their sizes and set the
logical screen to the largest width &amp; height included in the file.
<A NAME="screen_background"></A>
<P>
The Logical Screen Block also chooses one of the colors in the Global Color
Table to be the Background color of the screen. This color selection is ignored
by Netscape Navigator. If a GIF's background area shows through, Navigator
displays the color set in the BGCOLOR of the page's body or, if none is
specified, the background color set in the menus under OPTIONS/GENERAL
PREFERENCES/COLORS. Now, of course, the question arises; how do I get it
to be transparent? Well, this SHOULDN'T work, but it does. Apparently, if
Netscape's decoder finds a Control block (it must be first, before any images)
with Transparency turned on (any color) the background of the GIF will be
transparent. This will allows background GIFs to fill in the logical screen
background.
<P>
A GIF file contains a <I>global</I> palette of common colors for all the
images in its file to work from. (NOTE: It is technically possible for a
GIF NOT to have a global palette, but this would be extremely rare.) This
palette can have 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 , or 256 defined colors. Palettes
are very important. Every color displayed in your GIF must come from a palette.
The fewer colors used, the easier it will be for systems to display your
images. The global palette is applied to all images in a GIF file. If an
individual images differs greatly from that global palette, it may have a
local palette that affects its color ONLY. However, no image can every reference
more than one palette, so 256 colors per image is the max. Having a bunch
of local palettes with wildly varied colors can sometimes cause color shifts
in your display. (it also probably indicates a gaudy mix of colors)
<P>
The Logical Screen Header can also contain the aspect ratio of the image.
This can sometimes account for GIFs appearing stretched out or scrunched.
I will leave this to other who have use of this. <A NAME="net-extension"></A>
<H4>
  APPLICATION EXTENSIONS
</H4>
<P>
Usually a discussion on APPLICATION EXTENSIONS would be left to last. However,
this is an important issue, and is fitting to discuss at this point. Application
Extensions allow for blocks of data to be inserted in the GIF for specific
programs to act upon. It can be for any purpose. For this reason, only special
programs will do anything with them. The January '95 release of GIF Construction
Set 1.0G for Windows will insert the Netscape-specific loop-block into a
GIF. With these blocks, programs could specify special effects or instructions
on how to handle the image data. Typically, only the programs that define
these application blocks will understand them.
<P>
<B>OKAY...HERE IT IS...LOOPING!</B>
<P>
Netscape Navigator has an Application Extension Block that tells Navigator
to loop the entire GIF file. The Netscape block MUST APPEAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE GLOBAL COLOR TABLE OF THE LOGICAL SCREEN DESCRIPTOR. Only Navigator 2.0
Beta4 or better will recognize this Extension block. The block is 19 bytes
long composed of: (note: hexadecimal equivalent supplied for programmers)
<PRE>
byte   1       : 33 (hex 0x21) GIF Extension code
byte   2       : 255 (hex 0xFF) Application Extension Label
byte   3       : 11 (hex (0x0B) Length of Application Block 
		 (eleven bytes of data to follow)
bytes  4 to 11 : "NETSCAPE"
bytes 12 to 14 : "2.0"
byte  15       : 3 (hex 0x03) Length of Data Sub-Block 
		 (three bytes of data to follow)
byte  16       : 1 (hex 0x01)
bytes 17 to 18 : 0 to 65535, an unsigned integer in 
		 lo-hi byte format. This indicate the 
		 number of iterations the loop should 
		 be executed.
bytes 19       : 0 (hex 0x00) a Data Sub-block Terminator. 
</PRE>
<P>
As of Beta5, the iteration count is ignored and the loop is infinite (an
iteration count of zero indicates infinite). I strongly suggest you code
the count to be accurate, so that when iterations begin working your GIF
will not need to be modified. Technically that is all that needs to be done
with this block. <A HREF="gifmakg.htm#looping">More about looping</A> later
in the tutorial.
<H4>
  CONTROL BLOCKS
</H4>
<P>
A CONTROL BLOCK controls certain optional aspects of how an image is displayed.
A Control block only affect the image immediately following it. For this
reason, you should never include any block between a control block and the
next image descriptor block. This Graphic Control Extension defines:
<UL>
  <LI>
    if this image has a local palette of its own
  <LI>
    if one of the colors in this image is transparent
  <LI>
    if a user input is requested before proceeding
  <LI>
    if a timed delay in 1/100ths of a second should be used before displaying
    THIS image.
  <LI>
    what should be done with the image after it has been displayed (removal controls)
</UL>
<P>
You should avoid using a local palette as it increases the likelihood of
a confused video display. If a local palette doesn't exist, the global one
is used. One of these color is designated as transparent in the control block.
<P>
User input and timing work together. When an image is described, it is
immediately rendered on screen. Then, if a timed delay is set, it will wait
for <B>x/100ths of a second</B> before removal and proceeding onto the next
image. If a User Input is specified, the image waits until the user strikes
a key, clicks a mouse or whatever. What is considered <I>user input</I> is
determined by the program displaying the GIF. If both options are elected,
the image remains until the delay expires or a user input occurs, whichever
comes first.
<P>
Just before preceding to the next image, the removal options are performed.
You may remove the image by:
<UL>
  <LI>
    nothing: perform no action
  <LI>
    leave as is: leave the image on screen, should be same as nothing in most
    cases
  <LI>
    previous image: replace it with what was there before; this is difficult
    to implement and is the most powerful choice.
  <LI>
    background: replace with the logical screen background color. (note: If Navigator
    detected transparency, <A HREF="#screen_background">as written above</A>,
    this will be replaced by the HTML specified background)
</UL>
<H4>
  IMAGE BLOCK
</H4>
<P>
An IMAGE BLOCK contain (tada!) an actual image. This image can be any size
and have a palette of any size. You can have a mix of 16-color, 2-color,
256color, etc images in a single GIF. In addition to the actual image table
data you have the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    the picture's size in pixels
  <LI>
    the position of the image on the <I>logical screen</I>
  <LI>
    whether it is interlaced
  <LI>
    an optional local palette for this image
</UL>
<P>
The image's size in pixels cannot be modified. It is determined by the data
of the image. Changing this would cause data corruption.
<P>
The <I>top</I> and <I>left</I> position of the images are within the defined
logical screen. With this a small bitmap of an object could be placed anywhere
within the screen area, rather than create an entire image with the object
positioned within it. <A HREF="gifmake.htm#sequence">More on this</A> in
the tutorial.
<P>
Interlacing is a way of saving and displaying the image data. For interlacing
to occur, the image must be set to <B>save</B> interlaced. Interlacing is
not turned by the browser. It may be ignored by the browser. Interlacing
saves alternate rows, producing a venetian blind or blocky-focusing effect,
depending upon how the browser handles interlacing. Interlacing stores the
rows of the image in the following order:
<PRE>
      Pass 1 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 0.
      Pass 2 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 4.
      Pass 3 : Every 4th. row, starting with row 2.
      Pass 4 : Every 2nd. row, starting with row 1.
</PRE>
<H4>
  COMMENT BLOCK
</H4>
<P>
You can include comments in your GIF. These can be markers for long animation
sequences or statements of ownership. I strongly suggest that you place your
name, email, and home address in the GIF so people can contact you regarding
your work. These comments DO NOT appear on screen.
<H4>
  PLAIN TEXT BLOCKS
</H4>
<P>
In addition to images you can also render text on screen with a GIF.
Unfortunately many programs don't recognize the text. Netscape does not.
If you would like to learn more about the Plain Text Blocks read the
<A HREF="#specs">GIF89a Specification Sheet</A>.
<H4>
  TRAILER
</H4>
<P>
The Trailer is simple. It indicates the end of the GIF file. It is unmodifiable
and cannot be accessed in anyway. 
  <HR>
<P>
Here is an example of the structure of a typical animation file:

  What are the benefits &amp; limitations of GIF89a animations?
</H3>
<H4>
  Benefits
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>
    All the benefits of GIF: transparency, compression, interlacing,
    2,4,8,16,32,64,128 &amp; 256 color palettes for optimum size and compression.
  <LI>
    Supported by the basic Netscape 2.0 product. No Plug-ins or additional software.
    Tested on Win 3.1x, Win95, MAC, Unix, Sun, Linux, &amp; Irix.
  <LI>
    Web designer does not need access to internet provider's web server, server-side
    includes (SSI), or CGI/PERL scripting. If you have a program that can make
    multi-image 89a GIFs, you can make this animation.
  <LI>
    The animation is repeatable and reusable. You can place the same image on
    a page multiple times. It performs a single download for all and loops all
    from the cache.
  <LI>
    The animation only loads once, so your modem doesn't keep downloading constantly.
    It is faster than server-reliant methods. Check out
    <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~codex/race.html">the RACE</A>!
  <LI>
    The animations are surprisingly compact. The static image of a construction
    sign above is 4,471 bytes, while the animated version is only 7,080 bytes.
    The rolling stars (all of them :-&gt;) are 7,635 bytes.
  <LI>
    ANYONE can use them on their page. Anyone with a web page can include this
    animation. IN FACT, if you save any of the animated GIFs to your hard drive,
    you will have the entire animation to put in your own pages. Please contact
    the creator for usage.
  <LI>
    Works like any other GIF. Include on your page in an IMG or FIG tag, even
    anchor it. Works invisibly.
</UL>
<H4>
  Limitations
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>
    All the limitations of GIFs: max of 256 colors, photographs are better compressed
    by JPEG
  <LI>
    Only plays in Netscape 2.0 or better, but DOES work with many platforms (Windows,
    MAC, Unix, etc)
  <LI>
    Will play once or continuously. Refresh will not play the image again, but
    RELOAD or resizing the windows will. If the viewer returns BACK to the page
    from elsewhere, the image will play, EVEN if cached! Later revisions of Navigator
    may support finite iterations of the animations.
  <LI>
    It cannot be used as a background GIF. Only the first frame will display.
  <LI>
    <B>Netscape does not fully support GIF89a. </B>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Ignores user input.
      <LI>
	Does not handle <I>previous image</I> for image removal controls.
      <LI>
	Plain text is not displayed
      <LI>
	Bug in Windows version prevents timed displays of lower than 1/3 of a second
	between images.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    The animation can be slowed down or interrupted by other images being downloaded
    and other playing animations.
  <LI>
    Animation can be "borrowed" as easily as any GIF
  <LI>
    Non-supporting browsers either display the <I>first image</I> <B>(Win 3.x:</B>

  The GIF89a Specification
</H3>
<P>
Compuserve released the technical specification for GIF89a in July of 1989.
The technical specification is an exact breakdown of the byte-for-byte structure
and rules for interpreting and building this format. If you are interested
in a more technical explanation of the format, you can
<A href="gif89a.txt">read the specifications</A> as published by Compuserve.
This is the perfect documentation for anyone considering writing code to
deal with GIFs. The <A HREF="gif87a.txt">GIF87a Specifications</A> are also
available.
