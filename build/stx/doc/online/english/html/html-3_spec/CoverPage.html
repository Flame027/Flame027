<h2>Abstract</h2>

<P>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language
used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform
to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics
that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
applications. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail,
documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query
results; simple structured documents with inlined graphics and
hypertext views of existing bodies of information.

<P>This specification defines the capabilities of HTML version 3.0 and
provides additional capabilities over previous versions such as tables,
text flow around figures and math. It is backwards compatible with HTML
2.0.
