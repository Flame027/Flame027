<title>The ADDRESS element</title>
<h1>The ADDRESS element</h1>

<B>Permitted Context:</B> %Body.Content<BR>
<B>Content Model:</B> P or %text

<p>The ADDRESS element specifies such information as address, signature
and authorship for the current document, and typically placed at the top
or bottom of the document. When used with %text, the element acts similar
to a paragraph with breaks before and after.

<P>Example:

<PRE>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;
Newsletter editor&lt;BR&gt;
J.R. Brown&lt;BR&gt;
8723 Buena Vista, Smallville, CT 01234&lt;BR&gt;
Tel: +1 (123) 456 7890
&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;</PRE>

<H3>Permitted Attributes</h3>

<DL> <DT>ID <DD>An SGML identifier used as the target for hypertext
links or for naming particular elements in associated style sheets.
Identifiers are NAME tokens and must be unique within the scope of the
current document.

<DT>LANG <DD>This is one of the ISO standard language abbreviations,
e.g. "en.uk" for the variation of English spoken in the United Kingdom.
It can be used by parsers to select language specific choices for
quotation marks, ligatures and hypenation rules etc. The language
attribute is composed from the two letter language code from ISO 639,
optionally followed by a period and a two letter country code from ISO
3166.

<DT>CLASS <DD>This a space separated list of SGML NAME tokens and is
used to subclass tag names. By convention, the class names are
interpreted hierarchically, with the most general class on the left and
the most specific on the right, where classes are separated by a
period. The CLASS attribute is most commonly used to attach a different
style to some element, but it is recommended that where practical class
names should be picked on the basis of the element's semantics, as this
will permit other uses, such as restricting search through documents by
matching on element class names. The  conventions for choosing class
names are outside the scope of this specification.

<DT>CLEAR <DD>This attribute is common to all block-like elements. When
text flows around a figure or table in the margin, you sometimes want
to start the address element below the figure rather than alongside it.
The CLEAR attribute allows you to move down unconditionally:<BR><BR>

<DL>
<DT>clear=left<DD>move down until left margin is clear
<DT>clear=right<DD>move down until right margin is clear
<DT>clear=all<DD>move down until both margins are clear
</DL>

<P>Alternatively, you can decide to place the address alongside the
figure just so long as there is enough room. The minimum width needed
is specified as:<BR><BR>

<DL>
<DT>clear="40 en"<DD>move down until there is at least 40 en units free
<DT>clear="100 pixels"<DD>move down until there is at least 100 pixels
free
</DL>

<P>The style sheet (or browser defaults) may provide default minimum
widths for each class of block-like elements.

<DT>NOWRAP <DD>The NOWRAP attribute is used when you don't want the
browser to automatically wrap lines. You can then explicitly specify
line breaks using the BR element.

</DL>
