<h1>Admonishments</h1>

<B>Permitted Context:</B> %body.content, %flow, %block<BR>
<B>Content Model:</B> %body.content

<p>The NOTE element is designed for use as admonishments such as notes,
cautions or warnings, as commonly used in technical documentation. The
CLASS attribute specifies the type of the element and is typically
associated with different graphics such as a road traffic warning sign.
The graphic can be customized with the SRC attribute.

<p>Example:

<pre>    &lt;NOTE CLASS=WARNING&gt;Please check with the local weather
    service before starting your climb. The mountain weather
    is subject to rapid deterioration. It is essential to
    carry a good map and compass.&lt;/NOTE&gt;</pre>
    
<P>The class names: NOTE, CAUTION and WARNING are recommended for
standard admonishments. In the absence of the CLASS attribute, a NOTE
element is typically rendered indented, without an accompanying
graphic.

<H3>Permitted Attributes</h3>

<DL> <DT>ID <DD>An SGML identifier used as the target for hypertext
links or for naming particular elements in associated style sheets.
Identifiers are NAME tokens and must be unique within the scope of the
current document.

<DT>LANG <DD>This is one of the ISO standard language abbreviations,
e.g. "en.uk" for the variation of English spoken in the United Kingdom.
It can be used by parsers to select language specific choices for
quotation marks, ligatures and hypenation rules etc. The language
attribute is composed from the two letter language code from ISO 639,
optionally followed by a period and a two letter country code from ISO
3166.

<DT>CLASS <DD>This a space separated list of SGML NAME tokens and is
used to subclass tag names. By convention, the class names are
interpreted hierarchically, with the most general class on the left and
the most specific on the right, where classes are separated by a
period. The CLASS attribute is most commonly used to attach a different
style to some element, but it is recommended that where practical class
names should be picked on the basis of the element's semantics, as this
will permit other uses, such as restricting search through documents by
matching on element class names. Apart from the values suggested above,
the  conventions for choosing class names are outside the scope of this
specification.

<DT>CLEAR <DD>This attribute is common to all block-like elements. When
text flows around a figure or table in the margin, you sometimes want
to start the note below the figure rather than alongside it. The CLEAR
attribute allows you to move down unconditionally:<BR><BR>

<DL>
<DT>clear=left<DD>move down until left margin is clear
<DT>clear=right<DD>move down until right margin is clear
<DT>clear=all<DD>move down until both margins are clear
</DL>

<P>Alternatively, you can decide to place the note alongside the
figure just so long as there is enough room. The minimum width needed
is specified as:<BR><BR>

<DL>
<DT>clear="40 en"<DD>move down until there is at least 40 en units free
<DT>clear="100 pixels"<DD>move down until there is at least 100 pixels
free
</DL>

<P>The style sheet (or browser defaults) may provide default minimum
widths for each class of block-like elements.

<DT>SRC <DD>Specifies an image to appear preceding the note. The
image is specified as a URI. This attribute may appear together with
the MD attribute.

<DT>MD <DD>Specifies a message digest or cryptographic checksum for the
associated graphic specified by the SRC attribute. It is used when you
want to be sure that a linked object is indeed the same one that the
author intended, and hasn't been modified in any way. For instance,
MD="md5:jV2OfH+nnXHU8bnkPAad/mSQlTDZ", which specifies an MD5 checksum
encoded as a base64 character string. The MD attribute is generally
allowed for all elements which support URI based links.
