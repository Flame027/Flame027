<H1><A NAME="CREATING_AN_APPLICATION">Creating a GUI Application</A></H1>

In the previous sections, we have learned how simple classes can
be created - now lets create an application, which does something
useful with the Person-class objects, we defined there.
<P>

In order to make the code simple and easy to understand,
we will only create a very simple and easy to understand application:
a little person browser application.

<P>

The resulting application should be able to read Person objects from
a file, add new Persons to that database and finally save the persons
back onto the file.

<P>

In Smalltalk/X, a framework exists for typicaly applications, which
consists of the ApplicationModel, UIBuilder and ValueModel class hierarchies.
<BR>
In order to make use of this framework, we create our application class
as a subclass of <CODE>ApplicationModel</CODE>.



<H2><A NAME="CREATING_APP_CLASS">Creating a New Application Class</A></H2>
<P>
In the browser, select the <I>'New Application'</I> item from the
class-list-menu,
and accept the resulting class definition template:

<CODE><PRE>
    ApplicationModel subclass:#PersonBrowser
	instanceVariableNames: ''
	classVariableNames: ''
	poolDictionaries: ''
	category: 'Applications'
</PRE></CODE>



<H2><A NAME="CREATING_APP_FRAME">Generating the Initial Application Code</A></H2>

Then, switch the browser to 'class'-protocol, and select the
'generate initial application code' item from the
method-category-list-menu.
<BR>
This generates the basic protocol, which is required by all GUI
applications.
<P>
After that, you can already start your new application, either by
evaluating:
<CODE><PRE>
    PersonBrowser open
</PRE></CODE>
in a workspace, or by double-clicking on the <CODE>PersonBrowser</CODE>
class in the browser.
<P>
Of course, there is not more than an empty application window - for now.



<H2><A NAME="CHANGING_APP_MENU">Modifying the Application's Menu</A></H2>

As a next step, change the application's menu using the menuBuilder:
<BR>select the 'menu specs' category in the browser's method-category-list,
then double click on the <CODE>mainMenu</CODE> selector.
<BR>This opens a menuBuilder.
<BR>Remove the <I>'New'</I> and the <I>'Save'</I>
items from the <I>'File'</I> menu.
<BR>
When finished, save-back the changed menu either by clicking on
the menuBuilders 'Save' button, or by selecting the menuBuilders
<I>'Save'</I> menu-item.
<BR>
Then close the menuBuilder.
<P>
You may want to validate and reopen your application by double clicking
on the class again.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="CHANGING_APP_WINDOW">Modifying the Application's Window</A></H2>

Now, you should change the layout and appearance of our application,
to include a selection-list (to select a person) and a few inputFields
(to display and modify a persons data).
<BR>
To do so, open a windowPainter on the application's <CODE>windowSpec</CODE>
method (double click on the selector), and drag a selectionInListView
(from the galleries lists-section) and a few labels plus inputFields (from the galleries
'text'-section) into the drawing canvas.
<BR>
Arrange for the selectionList to occupy the top half of the window.
<P>
Now, your applications canvas should look like:
