<H1>Comanche Swiki</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

This goody represents of a port of the Comanche Swiki to Smalltalk/X.
<BR>
The port consisted of adding a squeak compatibility layer (a few mimicry-classes)
to allow for the original swiki-contents (i.e. the formatting code etc.) to remain
unchanged.
<P>
The Swiki should be enabled and configured via the new Settings Dialog (-> Launcher).


<H2>Documentation</H2>

A Swiki is a collaborative website; anyone can edit and create pages.
While that may seem dangerous, it's also amazingly powerful.
It turns out that we all know quite a bit about writing and talking together.
We tend not to mess up one another's space, we tend not to talk trash, and we tend to try to contribute.
<P>

<H3>History and Origin</H3>
Swikis are implemented in Smalltalk.
<BR>They were inspired by Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb.
<BR>The name "Wiki" comes from a corresponding hawaian word, which means "quick".
<BR>The Wiki was ported to Squeak (Squeak + Wiki = Swiki) by Mark Guzdial's Collaborative Software Laboratory
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
<BR>(Notice that the Comanche Swiki is not based on or related to the PWS-Swiki, which is another, earlier
implementation of a Wiki for Smalltalk).

<P>
General information on Wikis/Swikis is found on the
