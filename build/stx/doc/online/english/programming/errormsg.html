  This document lists some (most?) of the error and warning
  messages from various parts of the system.
  A short explanation of what the message means, and what

  When compiling with <VAR>stc</VAR>, error and warning messages
  may be either produced by <VAR>stc</VAR> itself, or by the c-compiler,
  during the second compilation phase.
<BR>
Remember: <VAR>stc</VAR> first creates C-code
  as intermediate code, and calls the c compiler for machine code
  generation.
<P>
  Stc-generated messages are of the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<VAR>file</VAR>.st, line <VAR>n</VAR>: <VAR>msgType</VAR>: some text
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  whereas messages produced by the C-compiler usually look like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<VAR>file</VAR>.c, line <VAR>n</VAR>: <VAR>msgType</VAR>: some text
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  (of course, the details depend on the type of c-compiler used,
   so no more information can be given here).
<P>
  There should be no error messages from the C-compiler,
  except in wrong defined primitive code. However, some C-compilers
  are more 'picky' than others and output warnings sometimes.
  These can usually be ignored (and <VAR>stc</VAR> will be fixed to output
  code which does not produce warnings).
<P>
The handling of some errors can be changed by <VAR>stc</VAR> command line arguments.
Also, warning messages may be disabled. See the <VAR>stc</VAR> manual page
for more info.

<UL>
<LI><CODE>
  Error: redefinition of 'foo' (line n)
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported, when a method for the same selector was
	already defined previously. The line number <VAR>n</VAR> tells
	the position of the previous method definition.

<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
check the code and rename/remove the method.
</UL>
<P>



<LI><CODE>
  Error: redefinition of 'foo' in instvar list
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported, when the same identifier occurs twice in the
	instanceVariableNames list of a class.
<BR>
	I.e. if you try to define some class as:
<CODE><PRE>
    Foo subclass:#Bar
	instanceVariableNames:'... x ... x ...'
	  ...
</PRE></CODE>

	here, the name ``<VAR>x</VAR>'' occurs twice.

<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	  check the definition and rename/remove the instance variable.
</UL>
<P>



<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: redefinition of 'foo' in arg/var list
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported, when the same identifier occurs twice in an
	argument list of a method or block.
<BR>
	I.e. if you try to define some method as:
<CODE><PRE>
	    methodWith:arg1 with:arg2 with:arg1
</PRE></CODE>
	here, the name ``<VAR>arg1</VAR>'' occurs twice.


<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	rename the argument.
</UL>
<P>



<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: instvar 'foo' is already defined in a superclass
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported when an instance variable with the same name
	is already defined in a superclass.
<BR>
	I.e. if you define a class such as:
<CODE><PRE>
    Point subclass:#MyPoint
	  instanceVariableNames:'... x ...'
	  ...
</PRE></CODE>
here, the superclass <CODE>Point</CODE> already defined an instance variable
named ``<VAR>x</VAR>''.


<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	  rename/remove the instance variable.
<P>
<LI>hint:
<BR>
	In special situations (you do not want to change the
	source), turn off the error with the <KBD>-errorInstVarRedef</KBD>
	command line argument. This tells <VAR>stc</VAR> to output a
	warning only, and continue compilation.
<BR>
	The resulting code will access the new instance variable
	in the subclass (and classes derived from these).
	The superclass continues to access its original instance
	variable - of course.
<P>
<LI>notice:
<BR>
	do not use this command line argument in general -
	it will lead to a sloppy coding style and may lead to
	unexpected behavior in your classes.
<BR>
	However, there is one situation where allowing instvar redefinitions
	makes sense and is very useful:
	 if you port a class from another smalltalk system.
<P>
	For example: if a subclass of <CODE>View</CODE> is to be brought to
	<CITE>ST/X</CITE> from <CITE>ST-80</CITE>, this may result in instvar
	redefinitions, since
	the inherited instance variables are certainly different in those
	class hierarchies and conflicts are possible (although not likely).
<BR>
	Since the conflicting instvar was not present in the
	original hierarchy, all references to it from within the new class
	are certainly meant for its own instance variable - not to the inherited one.
	Thus the semantic of accessing the own instvar is certainly the correct
	one for that class.
<P>
<LI>warning:
<BR>
	This should be only only used for a quick port of class code.
	In the long run, classes should be rewritten to have distinct instvar names.
</UL>
<P>






<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: global 'foo' is not uppercase
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported, when no variable <VAR>foo</VAR> was defined.
	For identifiers starting with an uppercase character, these
	undefined names are automatically taken to be global.
<BR>
	For others, this error is reported.


<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	  add the missing definition (instance variable or local variable)
<BR>
	or:
<BR>
	  change the name (to uppercase, if its meant to be a global)
<P>

<LI>notice:
<BR>
	it is considered bad style (but not strictly an error)
	to use lowercase names for globals and/or class variables.
	However, for compatibility
	(i.e. when porting code from other smalltalks) it is possible to
	turn this error into a warning with the <KBD>-errorLowerGlobal</KBD> compiler switch.
</UL>
<P>



<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: 'foo' is not lowercase
</CODE>
<BR>
	is reported when an instance variables, method/block locals
	or arguments name is starting with an upper case character.
	This is not strictly an error, but considered bad style.
	For compatibility (i.e. when porting code from other smalltalks)
	you can turn this error into a warning with the
	<KBD>-errorUpperLocal</KBD> command line argument.

</UL>




<H3><A NAME="STC_CLS_ERRORS" HREF="#I_STC_CLS_ERRORS">classes</A></H3>
<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: subclasses of Foo not allowed
</CODE>
<BR>
	this applies the classes <CODE>SmallInteger</CODE>,
	<CODE>UndefinedObject</CODE>,
	<CODE>True</CODE> and <CODE>False</CODE>.
<BR>
	For implementation reasons, you cannot create subclasses
	of these (neither with <CITE>stc</CITE> nor with the browser.

	<CODE>String</CODE>, <CODE>Symbol</CODE>, <CODE>Array</CODE>,
	<CODE>Behavior</CODE> and all of their superclasses.
<P>
	The instance layout of those class is known by (and built into)
	the VM. You may not add or remove instance variables or change its
	layout (i.e. introduce/remove indexed variables).

</UL>
<P>



<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: '!' must be duplicated (in string constant)
<BR>
  Error: '!' must be duplicated (in character constant)
</CODE>
<BR>
	since the input to <VAR>stc</VAR> is standard fileIn source format,
	individual methods must be separated by '!'-characters,
	and '!'-characters within methods must be doubled.
	This also applies to exclamation marks in strings and character
	constants.


<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	replace the single '!' by a double '!!'
<P>
<LI>notice:
<BR>
	this only applies to files edited with the fileBrowser
	      or other editor.
<BR>
	Do NOT double '!'-characters when entering code into the systemBrowser,
	since all fileIn/fileOut operations double/undouble exclamation marks
	automatically.
</UL>
<P>
</UL>


<H3><A NAME="STC_SEM_ERRORS" HREF="#I_STC_SEM_ERRORS">checked semantic</A></H3>

For some receiver/selector combinations, <CITE>stc</CITE> ``knows''
what kind of argument is required and reports errors if these are
incorrect. This may seem to make the implementation ``impure'' with
respect to object orientation, but usually helps the programmer by
flagging errors earlier (these will lead to a runtime error later, anyway).
<P>
Some of these checks can be turned of by <CITE>stc</CITE> command line
arguments, which will force it to generate code even for suspect constructs.

<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: body of whileTrue/whileFalse: must be a Block
</CODE>
<BR>
	the argument to a <CODE>while</CODE> message
	is known to be not a block. The compiler can (of course) not
	figure out all situations, in which this will happen at runtime.
	It is only reported for constant (non-block) arguments, or if <CITE>stc</CITE>'s
	type tracker can definitely assert a variables type to be a nonBlock.


<UL>
<LI>repair:
<BR>
	usually some bracket '[' or ']' is missing, or a typing error
	(round parentesis instead of brackets).
<P>
<LI>notice:
<BR>
	Unless the <CODE>"-optControl"</CODE> command line option is given,
	<CITE>stc</CITE> generates inline code for
	<CODE>#whileXXX</CODE>, <CODE>#ifXXX</CODE>, <CODE>#timesRepeat</CODE>,
	<CODE>#to:do:</CODE> and <CODE>#to:by:do:</CODE> constructs, iff the receivers type is known
	or can be tracked.
<BR>
	No real message send operation is performed at runtime for those.
<BR>
	This means that redefining the corresponding methods
	(in the Block-class) has no effect on program execution,
	except for explicit <CODE>#perform:</CODE> sends.
<P>
	You can force these methods to be executed by:
<CODE><PRE>
    [ ... ] perform:#'whileTrue:' with:[ .... ]
</PRE></CODE>
</UL>
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: body of ifTrue/ifFalse: must be a Block

<BR>
	like above.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>
  Error: body of whileTrue:/whileFalse: may not have args

<BR>
	an obvious error - the blocks in while-messages are evaluated
	without an argument.


<UL>
<LI>repair:

</UL>
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>

<h2><A NAME="STC_WARNINGS" HREF="#I_STC_WARNINGS">Stc warning messagess</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
  Warning: useless computation of constant (nil)
</CODE>
<BR>

	is output when an expression which evaluates to
	nil is detected, where the value is not used/needed.
	Typically, this is warning occurs with empty blocks as in:
<CODE>
<PRE>
   foo ifTrue:[] ifFalse:[....]
</PRE>
</CODE>

	This warning is somewhat questionable: it is reported
	for totally correct code.
<BR>
	However, in some situations, it may make sense to
	look into the code and check for commented out code
	which should not be.
<P>




<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: constant 1 in multiplication
</CODE>
<BR>

	<VAR>stc</VAR> generates code, which will perform the send of <CODE>#*</CODE>
	for non-numbers, and do nothing for <CODE>Integer</CODE> and <CODE>Float</CODE> receivers.
<BR>
You may want to have a look at the code to see if this multiplication is really needed.
<P>





<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: constant 0 in multiplication
</CODE>
<BR>

	<VAR>stc</VAR> generates code, which will perform the send of <CODE>#*</CODE>
	for non-numbers, and evaluate to the constant 0 for <CODE>Integer</CODE> and <CODE>Float</CODE>
	receivers.
<P>





<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: assignment to global variable 'FooBar'
</CODE>
<BR>

	is output whenever a global is assigned to.
	In Smalltalk, it is considered bad coding style to heavily
	use global variables - you should always think twice before
	doing so.
	Usually a class variable will give you the same functionality
	AND provide a better encapsulation (and also security, since
	assignments/modifications can be trivially cought by limiting
	access through a class method, while globals can be accessed and
	modified from everywhere).
<BR>
	This warning can be turned off with the <CODE>-warnGlobalAssign</CODE> flag.
<P>





<LI>
<CODE>
 Warning: declared 'Foo' as global
</CODE>
<BR>

	is output, when some variable has been declared as global by <VAR>stc</VAR>.
	This is done, whenever an otherwise undeclared name, which starts
	with an upper case alpha character is encountered.
	You may want to check, if this is the intention, since typing errors
	in a class variables name may lead to this.
<BR>
	If its really a global variable that is intented, you should declare it
	before using it, by adding a line such as:
<CODE><PRE>
    Smalltalk at:#Foo put:nil
</PRE></CODE>
	somewhere at the beginning of the file.
<P>




<LI>
<CODE>
  Warning: method var 'foo' hides instvar
<BR>
  Warning: block arg 'foo' hides instvar
</CODE>
<BR>

	whenever a method variable/block arg is locally defined,
	which has the same name as an instance variable.
<BR>
	This warning is output to remind you, that the instance variable
	is not reachable in this inner scope - which may or may not
	be the intent.
<P>




<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: block arg 'foo' hides method local
</CODE>
<BR>

	whenever a block arg is locally defined,
	which has the same name as a method variable.
<BR>
	This warning is output to remind you, that the method variable
	is not reachable in this inner scope - which may or may not
	be the intent.
<P>




<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: local 'foo' used before set
</CODE>
<BR>

	This may or may not be really an error - since the
	language definition states that local variables are
	initialized to <CODE>nil</CODE>, it is perfectly legal to depend
	on this (for example, to check for the first run
	through a loop).
<P>




<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: local 'foo' is always unassigned
</CODE>
<BR>

	A local variable is used, but never gets a value assigned.
	This is usually an  error. However, it conforms to the language definition,
	therefore only a warning message is generated.
<P>






<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: local 'foo' is never used
<BR>
  Warning: classvariable 'foo' is never used
</CODE>
<BR>

	an unused variable - the warning can usually be ignored,
	or the variables definition be removed.
<BR>
	In case of a classvariable, you should make sure that the
	variable is not used in subclasses before removing it (or move
	it to where it is supposed to be defined).
<P>




<LI>

<CODE>
  Warning: thisContext is unsafe in inlined blocks
</CODE>
<BR>

	A <CODE>thisContext</CODE> is encountered in a block, which is inlined;
	therefore </CODE>thisContext</CODE> will not return the blocks context,
	but instead the context of the enclosing block or method.
<BR>
	<VAR>Stc</VAR> may be changed in the future to either not inlining such blocks,
	or create a dummy context for the inlined block.
<P>
	You can avoid the ambiguity, by assigning <CODE>thisContext</CODE> to a local
	method variable outside the block (i.e. in the method), and use this
	local instead.
<BR>
	In general, to avoid compatibility problems with other smalltalk
	implementations, it is wise to not use <CODE>thisContext</CODE> in blocks.
<P>


<LI>
<CODE>
  Warning: if/while with unassigned receiver
</CODE>
<BR>

	A variable is used in an if or while expression, but
	that variable never gets a value assigned (i.e. is known to be nil).
<P>


<LI>
<CODE>
  Warning: possible typing error:'fooBar'
</CODE>
<BR>

	you have used a selector <CODE>fooBar</CODE>, which looks very obscure
	to <VAR>stc</VAR>.
<BR>
	Although the program is syntactically correct, you should
	check if the selector is really what you intented.
<BR>
	The set of obscure selectors has been determined by heuristics,
	by statistics over common bugs. Things like <CODE>ifTrue:ifTrue:</CODE>
	are among them. It is probably not complete, and more common typing
	errors are to be checked for.
<P>





<LI>
<CODE>
  Warning: end-of-line comments are a special ST/X feature
</CODE>
<BR>

	you have used the non portable end-of-line comment (<CODE>"/</CODE>). If you ever
	plan to transport the source code to another Smalltalk
	implementation, the code has to be changed.


</UL>

There are a few more (less frequent) error and warning messages which can be generated
by the compiler. All of them should be self explanatory.



<H2><A NAME="VM_DIAG" HREF="#I_VM_DIAG">Diagnostics produced by the runtime system</A></H2>

In case of a severe error, the runtime system (also called <VAR>VM</VAR>)
sends diagnostic to the standard errror (i.e. your shell terminal).
Also informational messages are occasionally output,
for example, garbage collection statistics.
<P>
Normally, you would not care for these messages,
except if <CITE>ST/X</CITE>'s output is piped to another program.
In this case, you may want to suppress these messages.
<BR>
(future versions will allow these to be written into a logfile as option)

<P>
Most debug &amp; error messages can be suppressed by evaluating:
<CODE><PRE>
	Smalltalk debugPrinting:false
</CODE></PRE>
for the error messages, and:
<CODE><PRE>
	Smalltalk infoPrinting:false
</CODE></PRE>
for the informal messages. You may place the above expressions into
any of your startup files, or evaluate them at any time in a workspace.
<P>
Alternatively, you can give additional command line arguments which
suppress  these messages right from the start:
<CODE><PRE>
	smalltalk -noDebugPrint -noInfoPrint
</PRE></CODE>
Finally, these can be enabled/disabled in the launcher's <VAR>settings-messages</VAR> menu.
<P>
Messages for very severe errors (crashes) cannot be suppressed.
<P>
Starting with <CITE>ST/X</CITE> release 3, all system messages are prefixed
by a subsystem name (such as <CODE>"IRQ"</CODE> or <CODE>"MEM"</CODE>),
which specifies the part within the VM, where the message was generated,
and a severity indicator (one of <CODE>"error"</CODE>, <CODE>"warning"</CODE>
or <CODE>"info"</CODE>).
<BR>
The subsystems are:
<DL>
<DT>IRQ<DD>the interrupt subsystem which handles the timer, user interrupts (CTRL-C),
I/O interrupts and memory access violations.
<DT>MEM<DD>memory management
<DT>IGC<DD>incremental garbage collector (within the memory system)
<DT>GC<DD>blocking (mark &amp; sweep) garbage collector (within the memory system)
<DT>CGC<DD>compressing garbage collector (within the memory system)
<DT>IMG<DD>snapshot image save &amp; reload subsystem
<DT>VM<DD>other message
</DL>
By convention, messages generated by Smalltalk code also follow the above
convention, but print the name of the class which generated the message.
<BR>
(This helps in searching for the origin of that message in the browser.)

the garbage collector found an invalid object reference to a

<BR>
This error should normally not happen and is usually worth a

However, <CITE>ST/X</CITE>'s memory manager is relatively robust against

One exception is when this error happens in the incremental GC;
continuing will probably lead to more errors of this kind.
You should terminate the incremental GC process.
<P>
In any case, you should try to save as much of your work as possible
(by filing out your classes) and restart the system from your
last saved image. You can try to write a new image; there are some
repair mechanisms built in, which nil out illegal references. If
the wrong pointer was caused by a bad primitive or external C subsystem,
chances are good that the system may continue to work.
However, do not overwrite your last image and do not overwrite
existing source files (i.e. write a new image, and fileOut into
a different directory) because you cannot be certain that the incore
source information is still valid and consistent.

	to allocate more memory for oldSpace objects.
<BR>
	Depending on the capabilities of your operating system,

<BR>
	On all systems which allow arbitrary mmap'ing of memory pages
	 (i.e. Linux, SGI, Suns, Unixware and some others), this operation

  MEM: very bad space conditions
</CODE>
<BR>

	the object memory is full and the operatingSystem is not willing
	to hand out more memory in an allocation request.
	This occurs if the smalltalk process has reached its (VM) limits,
	or if the system is running out of swap/paging space.
<P>
	Smalltalk cannot do much about this; however, a lowSpace interrupt
	is triggered, which sends a <CODE>#lowSpaceCleanup</CODE> message to
	all classes.
<BR>
	All classes which keep huge data (for example cached bitmap images or
	other reconstructable data) should implement a method for this message
	and release as much as possible there.
<BR>
	In rare situations, this error occurs in a loop (if the cleanup did not
	release enough memory, and further allocation requests failed as well).
<BR>
	In this case, you have to kill or otherwise terminate the smalltalk process
	manually (via the UNIX <VAR>kill</VAR> command).
	Then, either check your application for excessive memory requirements
	(endless loop when constructing some object hierarchy), or
	reconfigure your system to provide more swap space and restart from a saved
	image.
<P>
	Notice that some (bad) Unix systems simply kill the smalltalk process,
	so smalltalk gets no chance to perform the above cleanup actions or handle
	the error in a graceful way.
	Good systems return an error from the allocation (sbrk / mmap or malloc)
	request (this is a hint to OS designers ;-).

   an error was reported from the display connection (X-server).
<P>
   These are often a consequence of some view not being destroyed correctly.
   In this case, the garbage collectors finalization procedure frees
   the view and all of its subviews, by sending destroy requests
   to the display server.
<BR>
   However, those requests are ususally not sent in the views subview order,
   so that a superview may be destroyed before a subview.
   Since the server internally destroys all subviews with every superview
   destroy request,
   the subview-destroy request may be for such an already destroyed view
   and is reported by the server.
<P>
   Since the garbage collector has no idea of the view hierarchy, this
   annoying message is hard to suppress. As a programmer, you should always
   perform an explicit destroy on a topView when it is no longer in use.
   Be especially careful with popup boxes.

Smalltalk/X uses additional libraries and frameworks,

calling out to external programs.
These may generate additional information messages, which are not under control of
ST/X (and thus cannot be easily suppressed).

LC_CTYPE is set to "UTF-8", instead of "de.UTF-8" or "en.UTF-8".
The message vanishes, if you change LC_CTYPE as appropriate (i.e. $LANG.UTF-8)
in the calling shell (i.e. "export LC_CTYPE=de.UTF-8").
