<H1>SmaCC Compiler-Compiler Framework</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

These classes implement another framework for compiler construction.
They provide generators for scanners and parsers, and includes sample
code for smalltalk, java and C.

Description:
<P>
SmaCC (Smalltalk Compiler-Compiler) is a freely available parser generator for Smalltalk.
Use this package if you want to develop a new parser/scanner/compiler.
<P>

It  is a replacement for the T-Gen parser generator. T-Gen has several limitations
that make it difficult to produce parsers. SmaCC overcomes T-Gen's limitations.
For example, SmaCC  can generate parsers for ambiguous grammars and grammars
with overlapping tokens.  Both of these are not possible using T-Gen.
 In addition to handling more  grammars than T-Gen, SmaCC has a smaller runtime
than T-Gen and is faster than  T-Gen.
<P>

Take care to accept the code via CMD-s in the Text-Fields.
