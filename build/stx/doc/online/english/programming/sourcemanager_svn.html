<A NAME="INTRO" HREF="#I_INTRO"><H2>Introduction</A></H2>

<CITE>ST/X</CITE> includes interface classes
and browser support which allow smalltalk classes to be managed by
the <A HREF="man:svn">SVN</A> (<VAR>Subversion</VAR>)
sourcecode management system.

<P>
Access to the source containers is not limited or specific to <CITE>ST/X</CITE>;
all repository manipulations are also possible by shell commands - it is therefore
possible (and easy) to add automatic extraction and building via shell commands scripts.


<A NAME="SETUP" HREF="#I_SETUP"><H2>Setting up the SVN Repository</A></H2>

Unless your system alread has the SVN package
installed and operating (most linux systems will have),
you have to get an SVN distribution from some place, possibly compile it,
and install all of its commands to be found along your PATH.
<BR>
For Unix/Linux, we recommend placing the executables into <CODE>"/usr/local/bin"</CODE>;
for windows the installation typically asks for a directory where the binaries are to
be installed. Remember this, as you may need this path later unless the binaries
are included in the standard PATH.

<P>
IF you are unfamiliar with SVN, please take a look at the SVN documentation
and manual pages - not all required maintenance activities
are supported on the smalltalk level.
<BR>
Also, please do not trust on every detail described below;
by the time you read this, new SVN versions may behave slighlty different.
<P>

<P>
As a next step, you should create a repository, which will hold your
source tree. This has to be done only once, and is therefore not supported
by a fancy <CITE>ST/X</CITE> user interface.
<P>
... more to be documented here ...
<P>

After that, SVN is ready to be used with <CITE>ST/X</CITE>.





<A NAME="SOURCE_ACCESS" HREF="#I_SOURCE_ACCESS"><H2>Automatic Source Access via the Revision Management</A></H2>

Basically, the same rules and caching mechanisms are used as with the CVS source code manager.
Please refer to <A HREF="sourcemanager_cvs.html#SOURCE_ACCESS">CVS Sourcecode Manager</A> for details.

<A NAME="MODULES_N_PACKAGES" HREF="#I_MODULES_N_PACKAGESG"><H2>Modules and Packages</A></H2>

The SVN manager stores classes in subdirectories according to the ST/X package
hierarchy.
Please refer to <A HREF="sourcemanager_cvs.html#MODULES_N_PACKAGES">CVS Sourcecode Manager</A> for details.
