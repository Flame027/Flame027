<H1>Cryptographic Library</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This package consists of a set of smalltalk classes which implement
various cryptographic functions; especially, hashing, encryption, decryption,
random number generation, certificate handling and public key ring file parsing.
<P>
In addition, a sub-package implementing the SSL protocol (completely in Smalltalk,
not using any C-code, and therefore immune to buffer overruns) is also available.

<H2>Supported Hash Algorithms</H2>
The cryptographic library includes implementations of the following
hash algorithms:
<UL>
<LI>HMAC
<LI>LMHash
<LI>MD2, MD4 and MD5
<LI>MDC-2 (*1)
<LI>RipeMD160, RipeMD128
<LI>SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 & SHA512
<!-- <LI>SKEIN512 -->
<LI>SquareModN
<LI>UnixCrypt
<LI>Whirlpool
</UL>

<H2>Supported Encryption/Decryption Algorithms</H2>
The cryptographic library includes implementations of the following
crypt algorithms:
<UL>
<LI>Blowfish
<LI>Carmellia
<LI>CipherSaber
<LI>DES
<LI>GOST
<LI>IDEA (*2)
<LI>RC4 & RC6 (*3)
<LI>Rijndael
<LI>RSA
<LI>Serpent
<LI>Skipjack
<LI>TEA & XTEA
</UL>

<H2>Key Handling and Support functions</H2>
Additional support is provided for:
<UL>
<LI>DiffieHellman
<LI>ElGamal key generation
<LI>PGP keyring parsing
<LI>x509 certificates
<LI>pkcs signatures
<LI>Prime Number generation
<LI>Random Number generation
</UL>

<H2>Documentation</H2>
This document is available upon request.

<H2>Licensing</H2>
These addOn packages are licensed separately from the base ST/X system.

<P>

<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>MDC-2 used to be covered by a patent which was not renewed in 2003
and would have expired anyway in 2007. It can therefore be used without royalties.

<DT>(2)<DD>IDEA is provided for non-commercial use only
(see details in the PGP licence conditions);
<BR>
for commercial use, a licence agreement with the IDEA patent holder may be required.
Notice: the patent was applied in 1991, therefore expires in 2011-2012.

<DT>(3)<DD>RC6 is covered by a patent which expires 2018.
<BR>
It is not guaranteed that RC6 can be used royalty-free, as the patent holder has
not clearly stated his strategy.
For commercial use, a licence agreement with the RC6 patent holder may be required.
