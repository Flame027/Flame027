<H1>ROSE MDL-File Parser and Code Generator</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

The RoseMDLParser reads a design file, 
as created with the Rational Rose tool (an MDL file),
and parses it into a tree of definitions.
<BR>
This definition can then be fed into a code generator, 
which generates classes & methods right into the executing
smalltalk system.

<H2>Example</H2>

See examples in the classes <CODE>RoseParser</CODE>, <CODE>RoseMDL</CODE> and <CODE>RoseClassGenerator</CODE>.

<H2>Restricted use</H2>

we request that any changes/modifications & enhancements
made to them be returned to us (in source), to be reintegrated
into future versions.
