<H1>Refactory Browser</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

These classes implement an enhanced Browser, which is especially suited for code refactoring.
<P>
WARNING:
<BR>
the code has not been completely ported (from VisualWorks) yet, and some bugs may
show up when playing with this tool.
<BR>
The code as provided is a snapshot of the current work in progress and should be treated as such.
<P>

However, the refactoring- and change management- classes are also used by the NewSystemBrowser,
which provides a functionality similar to the RefactoryBrowser's.

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<H2>Example</H2>
Start the browser with:
<CODE><PRE>
