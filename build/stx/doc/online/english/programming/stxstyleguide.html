  One of the most annoying defects of many programming systems is inconsistency
  in its user interface.
<BR>
  This document is meant to provide some rules which may help to avoid this
  in the future of ST/X development.
<P>
  We are awareof the fact that this document is neither complete
  (feedback welcome) and the current ST/X system itself does not yet
  completely follow the rules as stated below - we are still working on it
  and fix the GUI as we come along.


<H2><A HREF="#I_LOOK" NAME="LOOK">General Look</A></H2>

<H3><A HREF="#I_LOOK_LAYOUT" NAME="LOOK_LAYOUT">Layout</A></H3>

If you ever plan to provide national variants of your program,
or want to allow the user to add translations himself,
leave enough space for longer texts in buttons, labels etc.
<BR>
I.e. always provide somewhat more space for your widgets.
<BR>
From our experience, national variants sometimes require more than twice
the amount of real estate.


<H3><A HREF="#I_LOOK_MESSAGES" NAME="LOOK_MESSAGES">Messages</A></H3>

When creating longer texts from fragments, be prepared that sentences are
have different structure in different languages;
NEVER construct by concatenating individually translated strings.
<BR>
The following is an example for VERY BAD coding style:
<CODE><PRE>
    Dialog
	information:(resources string:'Cannot read: ') , filename.
</PRE></CODE>

The reason for this to be so bad is that in many languages, the sentence must
be written in another order; for example, in German, you would write:
<CODE><PRE>
    &lt;filename> kann nicht gelesen werden
</PRE></CODE>

This germanstring cannot be constructed from the above english template by simple
text-translation.
<P>
Therefore, the above code should be written as:
<CODE><PRE>
    Dialog
	information:(resources string:'Cannot read %1' with:filename).
</PRE></CODE>
and a translation for German could be given (in a resource file) as:
<CODE><PRE>
    'Cannot read %1'        '%1 kann nicht gelesen werden'
</PRE></CODE>



<H3><A HREF="#I_LOOK_COLORS" NAME="LOOK_COLORS">Colors</A></H3>

Do not hard-code (i.e. program) any color information into applications.

<DL>
<DT>Widget Colors
<DD>Use the default colors as provided by the widgets - do not override them programatically.
<P>
If you really want (or think you need) to add fancy colors, do so via the
resource and/or styleSheet mechanism, which is user-configurable.
<P>

<DT>Alert Colors
<DD>Think twice about using alarm colors (such as red) in your application.
<BR>
When overused, these loose their alarming effect and you loose the ability to inform the user about real
trouble.

</DL>

<H3><A HREF="#I_LOOK_SOUND" NAME="LOOK_SOUND">Sound and Beeps</A></H3>

Do not (over-)use sound effects or beeps.
<P>
Just think about an office full of terminals which constantly emit awful win2000 startup melodies -
if at all, allow the user to turn these sounds off or let her configure individual acoustic alarms.





<H2><A HREF="#I_MENUS" NAME="MENUS">Window (PullDown-) Menus</A></H2>

<DL>
<DT>Window Menu
<DD>Every topView should have a window- (pullDown-) menu.
</DL>

<H3><A HREF="#I_MENUS_ITEMS" NAME="MENUS_ITEMS">Menu Items</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>Exit Item
<DD>The menu should have an exit item somewhere - preferably in the leftMost submenu, which
is usually the <VAR>"file"</VAR> menu.
<P>
Although most windowing systems do provide a close function in their window decoration,
some (especially older, puristic ones like twm) do not.
<BR>
Also, some window managers close function is actually a "kill" function, in that it kills the whole
application (i.e. the whole smalltalk) instead of asking it to close that individual window.

<P>
By always providing an exit menu item, these problems can be avoided.
<P>

<DT>Help Menu
<DD>The menu should have a <VAR>"help"</VAR> submenu.
This submenu should have (at least) an item which leads to a general tool document - preferrably
a hypertext document (html, pdf or similar).
<P>

<DT>Visible vs. Disabled
<DD>All items should be visible.
Items which are inappropriate for the tools state (for example: nothing selected) should be
disabled instead. Disabled items are typically shown in a grey color.
<P>
The problem with invisible items is that a newcomer (and often even experts) will have a hard time
to learn about the functionality which is offered by a tools menu, if the set of items changes
with the state of the tool.
<BR>
New users typically try all menus to see which functions are provided by which menu and will have
a longer learning curve, if some items are invisible.
<P>

</DL>

<H3><A HREF="#I_MENUS_LABELS" NAME="MENUS_LABELS">Menu Labels</A></H3>

Use the so called "headline capitalization" for english menu item labels - that is:
<UL>
<LI>capitalize the first word.
<LI>capitalize all nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.
<LI>do not use punctuation (i.e. no period at the end).
<LI>mark items which ask for more information by opening a dialog or confirmer,
by a trailing "...".
</UL>

Notice that in many other languages, this kind of capitalization is
NOT used and actually looks ugly.
<BR>
For example, in German, the normal sentence capitalization rules apply
(i.e. capitalize the first word, then only capitalize nouns).



<H3><A HREF="#I_MENUS_ITEMS" NAME="MENUS_ITEMS">Menu Items</A></H3>

Do not make menus too big - if you need more than (say) 10 items, create submenus.
<BR>
Group items by function and keep the ordering of groups consistent among different
applications.
<BR>
