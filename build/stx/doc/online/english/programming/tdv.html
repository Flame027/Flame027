<H1>TDV Technical Data Viewer</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

This goody implements a framework for 3D visualisation of technical data.
<BR>
Typical applications include quality monitoring (factory automation,
telecom etc.).
<P>
The framework has been written to allow for easy change/customization
of the rendering process. 
<BR>
Especially rendered graphic parts such as grids, scales etc. are all
implemented as separate objects, and can be easily changed/subclassed for
a particular application.
<P>
The data-gathering mechanism is not part of the TDV framework and
must be written for a particular application 
<BR>
To display realTime data, usually, some shared
memory interface to the realTime process is added;
<BR>
for non-realTime display, the data may also be read from a file or
via some IPC (interprocess communication) mechanism.

Technical data can be displayed basically in two forms:
<UL>
<LI>A fixed 2-dimensional matrix of values 
<LI>A one dimensional data vector over time
</UL>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>
This goody requires the openGL interface package.
