<H1>STMath - Mathematic Objects</H1>

<H2>Summary</H2>


StMath is a set of math objects that have been derived from a motion simulation program.
It is not intended to be comprehensive, but believed to be suitable for engineering type applications
and contributed it to the general Smalltalk community.
<BR>
It has Linear Algebra, Newton-Raphson,
numerical solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
and Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE),
and some Symbolic Math with Symbolic Differentiation.
<BR>
The Symbolic Math works with the Newton-Raphson and solution of ODE and DAE.
<P>
To learn to use StMath run the examples in StMathHelp class methods.
