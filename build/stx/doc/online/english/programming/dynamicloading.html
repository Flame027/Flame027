<A NAME="INTRO" HREF="#I_INTRO"><H2>Introduction</A></H2>

On systems which support dynamic loading of object modules,
(currently, these are: SGI, Linux (both a.out and ELF based),
Unixware, SUNOS4.x),
<CITE>ST/X</CITE> allows that binary files are
loaded and unloaded dynamically to the running system
- without a need to leave the session.

<P>


<A NAME="CLASSLIBRARIES" HREF="#I_CLASSLIBRARIES"><H2>Binary classlibraries (packages)</A></H2>

Binary class libraries consist of a group of classes, which are
contained in a single object file and loaded/unloaded together.
<BR>
Class libraries can be statically included in the initial executable
(the whole system that surrounds you typically is) or,
alternatively, added dynamically to an executing image.


<A NAME="LOADING" HREF="#I_LOADING"><H3>Loading</A></H3>
<P>
To load a class library, select it in the fileBrowser,
and execute the <VAR>fileIn</VAR> menu function.
<BR>
The system automatically detects the file as a binary object
(in contrast to a smalltalk source file) and loads it
as a binary object.

<P>
Programmatically, this can be done with:
<CODE><PRE>
    Smalltalk fileIn:'path-of-the-binary-file'
</PRE></CODE>

The pathName argument must specify the binary objects
complete path, including any suffixes (such as "<CODE>.so</CODE>" or
"<CODE>.dll</CODE>").
<BR>
This is of course not portable across different architectures,
both due to differnet directory names, and
since filename extensions are highly system specific.
<BR>
If you can place your class libraries into some standard directory
(i.e. a directory named "<CODE>binary</CODE>" somewhere in the <VAR>searchPath</VAR>),
you should use a more portable interface, which only
requires the binaries base name, and uses the architecture specific
filename extension:
<CODE><PRE>
    Smalltalk fileInClassLibrary:'name-of-the-library'
</PRE></CODE>
The <VAR>searchPath</VAR> is the standard <VAR>ST/X</VAR> searchpath, which can be
defined via the shell environment or in the "<CODE>startup.rc</CODE>" file.

Thus, a programmer using dynamic class libraries should write:
<CODE><PRE>
    Smalltalk fileInClassLibrary:'libFoo'.
</PRE></CODE>
and place the corresponding "<CODE>libFoo.so</CODE>" or "<CODE>libFoo.sl</CODE>"
or "<CODE>libFoo.dll</CODE>" file into one of the binary directories.
<BR>
(you can also ask the <CODE>ObjectFileLoader</CODE> class about the systems
 preferred file extension and construct the files full name manually;
try <CODE>"ObjectFileLoader&nbsp;sharedLibraryExtension"</CODE>).
<P>
When loaded, all classes contained in that package are installed,
and <CODE>#initialize</CODE> messages are sent to the classes in the
order of inheritance (i.e. superclasses get this message before any
subclasses). Classes of which the superclass is missing (i.e. a binary
class of which the superclass is in another binary file) will not be
installed; however, these are rememebred to be installed and initialized
as soon as the missing superclass is loaded. If the missing superclass is
marked as an autoloaded class, <CITE>ST/X</CITE> tries to load it first,
by searching for an appropriate binary (along the searchPath).

<P>
If the classLibrary contains any class named after a class
in the executing image, the old class will remain physically present
as an object, but will be no longer accessible via the global
name table (i.e. <CODE>"Smalltalk at:name"</CODE> will return the new class).
<BR>
This allows existing instances to continue to function correctly,
in case the instance layout changes, or invalid code is loaded, or
the load failed for some reason.
<P>

If a class library is reloaded (i.e. it was already loaded), the old
code is unloaded (see below) before the new code is read.



<A NAME="UNLOADING" HREF="#I_UNLOADING"><H3>Unloading</A></H3>

Once loaded, the system keeps track of which objects are loaded
and which classes/methods refer to instructions in that library.
<BR>
The finalization mechanism is used to detect when the last reference to
the object file ceases to exist (i.e. there are no more methods/classes
from that module in the system) and the module is <b>automatically</b> unloaded.
<P>
This happens, if you remove those classes in the browser AND there are
no more instances of them in the system.
<P>
You can also <b>force</b> a class to be unloaded, by opening the launcher's
<VAR>file-modules</VAR> dialog, selecting a package and pressing the
<VAR>unload</VAR> button. By the way: this dialog also shows a packages
contents and the classes revision numbers - useful to validate a correct
version has been loaded.
<P>
Existing methods which still refer to this binary are no longer executable.
(the browser marks them as <VAR>** unloaded **</VAR> and a method invocation will
raise an <VAR>invalidCode</VAR> exception).
<P>
Since the unload is automatic in normal circumstances,
no special programming interface exists for unloading.
<BR>
(However, see the "<CODE>ObjectFileLoader</CODE>" class for low level
 access to loaded modules and load/unload functionality.
<BR>
 This classes protocol is private and subject to changes,
 and we do not guarantee this to remain unchanged forever.)

<P>
Before the actual unlaoding is performed, all classes in the module
receive a <CODE>#deinitialize</CODE> message, to give them
a chance to perform any required cleanup actions.
<P>
You can also arrange for <CODE>#aboutToUnload</CODE> change notifications
to be sent - to either the unloaded classes or any other watcher object.
<BR>
To receive these, the interested object must be
a dependent of the <CODE>ObjectFileLoader</CODE> and check for
a <CODE>#aboutToUnload</CODE> argument in the <CODE>#update:with:from:</CODE>
method. The second <CODE>with:-</CODE> argument will be the class
which is about to be unloaded.
<BR>
If the unloaded class is itself interested, it should check this argument
for identity to itself, before performing any cleanup actions.
(which is why the <CODE>#deinitialize</CODE> mechanism is probably easier
to use ...).



<A NAME="ERRORS" HREF="#I_ERRORS"><H3>Errors during the load</A></H3>


While loading, new classes are validated against their superclasses
definitions and the installation of a class or a number of classes
may be suppressed.
<P>
The error most likely to occur is that a compiled class inherits from
some other class, which has changed its definition (i.e. added or removed an
instance variable) in the meanwhile, and the subclass has not been recompiled.
<BR>
This situation is detected, by comparing the classes signatures, and ignoring
any class(es) from the package, for which this check fails.
<BR>
Other (valid) classes are not affected and the package may be partially loaded.
<P>
Therefore, as a programmer, it is a good idea to check for all expected classes
to be present after the load.
<P>

<A NAME="SNAPSHOTS" HREF="#I_SNAPSHOTS"><H3>Snapshot images & dynamic libraries</A></H3>

When a snapshot image is saved, sufficient information about all loaded
binaries is kept and saved with the image, to allow those modules to
be reloaded at restart time.
<P>
Therefore, be careful when removing any binary class libraries - there could
still be references from some passive snapshot images to them !!
<P>

If some binary is no longer present or loadable at restart time, all methods
depending on it are invalidated (similar to the above described unload behavior).
<BR>
This means, that the image is still runnable, as long as those missing
methods are not invoked. If they are, you'll end up in the debugger.



<A NAME="CLASSES" HREF="#I_CLASSES"><H2>Individual binary classes</A></H2>

The required actions to load object files containing individual classes
(as opposed to packages) are the same as described above.
<BR>
However, the Makefiles as created by the configuration process
(or <VAR>stmkmp</VAR>) are not prepared to generate such files.
<BR>
Therefore, you have to either manually change the "<CODE>Make.proto</CODE>"
files, or by generating a loadable file via command line linker invokation.
<P>
The details vary among system architectures:

<P>
Since the existing makefiles ``know'' how to create loadable classLibraries
(if supported by your architecture),
we recommend placing all binary classes into a classlibrary - even if it
only consists of a single object file.
<BR>
If you insist on creating loadable modules consisting of a single class,
you have to create those ``manually'' on some systems.
<P>


<A NAME="CLIBRARIES" HREF="#I_CLIBRARIES"><H2>C libraries / C modules</A></H2>

Beside smalltalk class binaries, ordinary c object modules and libraries
can be dynamically loaded with:
<CODE><PRE>
    |moduleHandle|

    moduleHandle := ObjectFileLoader
			loadDynamicObject:'binary-object-path'.
</PRE></CODE>
the individual functions are extracted with:
<CODE><PRE>
    |functionHandle|

    functionHandle := moduleHandle
			getFunction:'nameOfCFunction'.
</PRE></CODE>
and finally, that function is callable via:
<CODE><PRE>
    functionHandle call
</PRE></CODE>
There are various call methods provided, for passing different types and
number of arguments to the C function. See the <CODE>ExternalFunction</CODE>
classes protocol for detailed information.
<P>
Like with class libraries, these modules can be unloaded, making the corresponding
function handles become invalid (calling them leads to a </VAR>primitiveFailure</VAR>
exception) and are reloaded when a snapshot image is restarted.
<P>
If the binary contains a function named "<CODE>__&lt;fileName&gt;__Init()</CODE>", that function
is called when the module is loaded. This allows initialization code
to be performed automatically, before any other function calling takes place.
<BR>
This function is also called when the binary is reloaded at image restart time.
<P>
In addition to initialization, this function can also signal failure by
returning a negative integer value (i.e. -1). In this case, the module will
be immediately unloaded and failure will be reported to the caller on the
smalltalk side.
<BR>
To report success, the init function must return a value >= 0.
<P>

A similar de-init function named "<CODE>__&lt;fileName&gt;__deInit()</CODE>"
is called (if present in the binary) when the module is unloaded, allowing
the C code to perform any required cleanup.
<P>
The deinit function is always called - even if the unload is due to
the init functions failure return.
<P>
Example c files usable for dynamic load experiments
are found in <A HREF="../../../coding/cModules">"<CODE>doc/coding/cModules</CODE>"</A>.

<A NAME="SYSTEMSPECIFICS" HREF="#I_SYSTEMSPECIFICS"><H2>Architecture specific notes</A></H2>

Some systems require special actions, for shared objects to be created;
the following only applies to specific systems.

<A NAME="SYSTEMSPECIFICS_AIX" HREF="#I_SYSTEMSPECIFICS_AIX"><H2>AIX (3.2.5) shared objects</A></H2>

On aix (3.2.5), the linker needs an exports file (which defines the symbols
of a shared object, which are to be exported), and also import files
which define the names to be imported from other shared objects.
<P>
The makefiles as provided create export files, which must be kept aside the
corresponding classLibrary file (if you move/copy shared objects to other machines,
do not forget to copy those as well).
<BR>
The exports file of the runtime library has been created by hand, and is found
in <CODE>"librun/librun_aix.exp"</CODE>.
<P>
At link time, these exports files must be present and reachable.
<P>
We recommend, creating a directory named: <CODE>"/usr/local/lib/smalltalk/lib"</CODE>,
where all shared libraries and export files are copied to (especially, the librun-exports file).
<P>
To create a shared object, use the command (or make-rule):
<CODE><PRE>
    cc -bI:/usr/local/lib/smalltalk/lib/librun_aix.exp
       -bE:libName.exp
       -bM:SRE
       -o libName.so
       libName.o
</PRE></CODE>
after that, <CODE>"libName.so"</CODE> is ready to be loaded via <VAR>fileIn</VAR>.

<P>
If individual methods containing inline C-code are to be <VAR>accepted</VAR>
in the browser, the system executes a command similar to the above.
<BR>
Here, you also have to make certain, that <CODE>"librun/librun.so"</CODE>
and <CODE>"librun/librun_aix.exp"</CODE> have been copied to
<CODE>"/usr/local/lib/smalltalk/lib"</CODE> - otherwise, the linkage operation
will fail.

<A NAME="SYSTEMSPECIFICS_SOL" HREF="#I_SYSTEMSPECIFICS_SOL"><H2>Solaris shared objects</A></H2>

Dynamic class libraries must be compiled with the -fPIC compiler option;
otherwise, a segmentation violation may occur when the object is
loaded. The configuration as delivered already contains the required
definitions, so that Makefiles when generated from a Make.proto will
have this option set.
<BR>
If the dynamic object needs other dynamic libraries, make certain that
those will be found at load time - either by adding the path to the library
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH shell variable, or by placing a copy/symbolic link
to those libraries into your current directory, or by adding a -Rpath
option to the link command of your class library.
