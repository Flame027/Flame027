To add a page to your personalized workspace,
and arrange for it to be automatically included whenever
a "MyWorkspace" is opened,
perform the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Add the tab (<I>"Add Page"</I> button in the toolbar menu)
<LI>Enter the text into the new page
<LI>Save the page's contents
<br>We recommend that you save the contents as a file in the
<CODE>".smalltalk"</CODE> directory of your home director (home button in the save-file dialog).
It is not a good idea to save it within the Smalltalk installation tree,
because that would be lost, whenever you reinstall a new smallalk version.
<LI>Add a bookmark, via the "Add Bookmark Here" item in the <I>"Bookmarks"</I>-><I>"My Workspaces"</I>
submenu
</OL>
