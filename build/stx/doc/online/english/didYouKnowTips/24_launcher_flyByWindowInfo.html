Very often, you need to inspect an application or a window which you see on the screen.
There are many ways to get to the object or the code of something you see on the screen:
<ul>
<li> via the window-tree
<br>
The window tree is opened via the Launcher's
"<VAR>Window</VAR>" - "<VAR>Window Hierarchy</VAR>" menu item.
<p>

<li> via point-and-inspect
<br>
In the same menu, you find the "<VAR>Inspect Window</VAR>" item, which lets you click on
a window and opens an inspector on it.
<p>

<li> via name-and-inspect
<br>
Found in the same menu, this presents a list of window-labels, to open an inspector based on the selected name.
<p>

<li> via the flyBy window information
<br>
Probably the nicest way to get to the info is via the "<VAR>FlyBy Window Information</VAR>" function.
This first brings you into the "info mode", which is left by pressing the ESC-key.
In info-mode, some information about a view is shown, as you move the mouse over it.
Pressing one of the keys in "votam" opens an inspector on the view, the model, the topView,
the application or the master-application respectively.
<p>

<li> via the process monitor
<br>
In the processes-monitor, first select a process instance, then the menu function
"<VAR>Debug</VAR>" - "<VAR>Inspect Application</VAR>"
or
"<VAR>Debug</VAR>" - "<VAR>Browse Application</VAR>"


</ul>
