In the launcher's "<VAR>Window</VAR>"-menu, you will find an item named
"<VAR>Window Hierarchy</VAR>". If you select this item, a crosshair cursor will show up,
and ST/X waits for you to click on any Smalltalk window on the screen.
<P>
After clicking, that windows widget hierarchy will be shown in a graphical inspector view.
<P>
You can further investigate the attributes of the widgets by selecting it in the tree
and choosing one of the
right-button popUp-menus functions.
