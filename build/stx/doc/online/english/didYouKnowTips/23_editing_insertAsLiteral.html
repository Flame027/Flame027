    <TITLE>Inserting as Literal String</Title>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>

Programmers sometimes need an existing string or file-contents as a literal
String (String constant) in their program code.
The trouble with simply copy-pasting such a string is that all existing single quote
characters have to be doubled. Otherwise, it will not be a legal string literal.
<P>
The editor's popup menu offers two functions to do this for you:
To insert a file, select
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"<VAR>More</VAR>" - "<VAR>More</VAR>" - "<VAR>Insert File as String Literal</VAR>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and choose a filename.
<P>
To insert a string which is already in the copy-paste buffer,
select:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"<VAR>More</VAR>" - "<VAR>More</VAR>" - "<VAR>Paste as String Literal</VAR>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
