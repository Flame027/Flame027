  <BODY>

You can drag and drop a file into a workspace (actually: into any Text-Editor).
When dropping, you are asked if you want to drop the name of the file (the pathName) or
the contents. By pressing SHIFT or ALT, this dialog can be bypassed: press SHIFT to force
a name-drop and ALT, to force the contents to be dropped without any questions asked.
<P>
For directories, the name is always dropped.
