  <BODY>

Late notice: we have made quickstart the default; if you need the old behavior,
use the new "<I>--autoload</I>"  option.
<P>

If you start ST/X with a "<I>--quick</I>" command line option, it will not scan the filesystem
for autoloadable classes. This results in a <B>MUCH</B> faster startup.
However, you must now ensure that the any missing classes are loaded from their package.
<br>Packages can be loaded via the Launcher's <I>"Load Package"</I> menu item,
or by evaluating:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    Smalltalk loadPackage:&lt;nameOfPackage&gt;
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A good place to keep such package-load instructions is "<CODE>MyWorkspace.wsp</CODE>",
which - if such a file is present in the current directory -
is shown automatically in the SystemWorkspace.
<P>
Another option is to edit the autoloaded-package's list in the Launcher's <I>"Settings"</I> - <I>"System"</I> - <I>"Autoloaded Packages"</I> list.
<P>
The quickstart option is also recommended to check if all required classes are present
for a deployed stand-alone binary executable (which can/should not load missing
classes dynamically).
