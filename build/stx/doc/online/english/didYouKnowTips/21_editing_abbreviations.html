By pressing the <KBD>Alt</KBD>-<KBD>Space</KBD> combination,
an abbreviation's espansion is inserted. The abbreviation is the word before the text-cursor.
Functions to manage abbreviations are found in the workspace-menu.
The set of predefined abbreviations is tailored towards the typical Smalltalk programmer,
however, you can add your own in the "<CODE>private.rc</CODE>"-
or "<CODE>p_</CODE><VAR>yourName</VAR><CODE>.rc</CODE> file.
<P>
For example, the abbreviation "<KBD>itf</KBD>" is replaced
by a "<CODE>ifTrue:ifFalse:</CODE>" code fragment.
