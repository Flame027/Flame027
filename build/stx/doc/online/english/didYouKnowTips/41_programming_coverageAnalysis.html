The new system browser allows for classes and methods to be instrumented for coverage analysis.
First, use the class- or method-menu item "<VAR>Debug</VAR>" -> "<VAR>Recompile with Instrumentation</VAR>" on individual
or groups of classes/methods.
Then, enable the coverage display in the browser's "<VAR>View</VAR>"-menu.
Finally, execute your code (typically using either the embedded or the external sunit test runner).
As code is executed, classes, methods and code are recolored according them being covered or partially covered.
