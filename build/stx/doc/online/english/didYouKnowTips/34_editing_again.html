  <BODY>

By pressing the "<KBD>F8</KBD>" (Again)-key,
the last replace or delete operation is repeated.
For example, to replace all strings 'aaa' by 'bbb' in a text,
select the first occurrence of 'aaa', type 'bbb' (to replace it),
and then simply press "<KBD>F8</KBD>" to let the editor search for the next 'aaa'
and perform the replace operation again.
<P>
The right-button menu of the edit window also contains an entry called "<I>Again - for All</I>"
which repeats the operation until no more occurrences of the string are found.
