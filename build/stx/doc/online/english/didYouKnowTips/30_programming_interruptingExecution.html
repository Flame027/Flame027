    <TITLE>Interrupting a Running Program</Title>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
A running program can be interrupted in various ways:
<H3>Interrupting</H3>
Pressing the "<KBD>Interrupt</KBD>"-key ("<KBD>Untbr</KBD>" on german keyboards)
in a window will interrupt that window's process and open a debugger on it.
For those used to Squeak or Visualworks Smalltalk systems, the
"<KBD>Alt-.</KBD>" (alt-period) and "<KBD>Ctrl-.</KBD>" key-combinations
also show this behavior.
<P>
Leave the debugger, either by proceeding, aborting or terminating.
<UL>
<LI>proceed
<BR>The interrupted process will continue where it was interrupted.
<P>
<LI>abort
<BR>The interrupted process will be sent the Abort-signal. This signal is cought
in every window-processes event loop and also in a workspaces doIt-evaluator.
Thus, this usually gets you out of a faulty computation and brings you back into the
command processor.
<P>
<LI>terminate
<BR>The interrupted process will be terminated. If the process is a window-handling process,
the corresponding window will typically be closed due to the processes cleanup actions:
Occasionally, the window stays open (in case there is a bug in the processes unwind actions, and
the cleanup cannot be performed correctly). If this happens, close the window using the launcher's
<NOBR>"<I>Window</I>"</NOBR> - <NOBR>"<I>Close</I>"</NOBR> menu function.
</UL>
<P>
More information on the debugger is found in the
<A HREF="../getstart/tut_1.html#DEBUGGER">tutorial</A>
and in the
<A HREF="../tools/debugger/TOP.html#DEBUGGER">debugger's documentation</A>.

<P>
<H3>Aborting</H3>
Pressing the "<KBD>CTRL-Interrupt</KBD>" ("<KBD>CTRL-Untbr</KBD>" on german keyboards)
will abort the running process. This is the same as an interrupt followed by aborting in the debugger.
The process receives the Abort-signal and is thrown back into its main event loop
(or doIt command-loop, if it is a workspace).

<P>
<H3>Interrupting on the Console</H3>
A runaway non-GUI process can be interrupted by pressing "<KBD>CTRL-C</KBD>" on the
console (xterm) window. However, ST/X must have been started with a console window
beforehand ("stx.com" vs. "stx.exe").

<P>
<H3>Using the Process Monitor</H3>
If you have a access to a
<A HREF="../tools/misc/TOP.html#PROCESSMONITOR">process monitor window</A>
(or you can open one in the launcher),
you can also interrupt, stop, abort or terminate any other process from there.

<P>
<H3>Breakpointing</H3>
If you have a access to another browser window (or you can open one in the launcher),
you can also place a breakpoint on a method which is known to be called by your runaway
program. I.e. you don't need to stop a program for a breakpoint to become active.
However, this only works if ou have any idea on what the runaway process is going to
do.
