  <BODY>

Beside globals, ST/X supports another scope for variables,
which has the same lifetime as globals, but is only visible
to workspace evaluations. These are called <DFN>Workspace Variables</DFN>.
They allow for an object reference to be shared between workspaces
and is very useful when debugging.
<P>
Workspace variables can be declared interactively via a dialog,
or the workspace setting is changed to have unknown variables automatically defined as such.
However, this automatic definition is limited to workspace evaluations.
