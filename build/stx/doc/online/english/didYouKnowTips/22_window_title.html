You can arrange for a prefix string to be added to all of the ST/X windows.
This is especially useful, if you have multiple Smalltalk images open on the same screen
and you are loosing track of which browser belongs to which image ;-).
<P>
To cahnge the window titles, open a settings dialog from the launcher,
navigate to the "<VAR>Window Style</VAR>" item,
enable "<VAR>Window Label Format</VAR>" checkbox at the bottom,
and enter an appropriate string into the inputfield.
<P>
All of your windows get this string as a prefix.
