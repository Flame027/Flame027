If a file named <NOBR>"<CODE>MyWorkspace.wsp</CODE>"</NOBR> exists in the Smalltalk startup directory,
every opened workspace will automatically add a page on that file's contents.
<P>
There is also a workspace menu item called "<I>Add Page with MyWorkspace</I>",
which does this for a normal workspace.
<P>
This is very useful for commonly reoccurring expressions or text-fragments:
simply type them into a Workspaces, and save its contents under the file named
<NOBR>"<CODE>MyWorkspace.wsp</CODE>"</NOBR>.
