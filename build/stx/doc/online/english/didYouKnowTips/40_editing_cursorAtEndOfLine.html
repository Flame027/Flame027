    <TITLE>End-of-Line Behavior of the Cursor</Title>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>

The cursor behavior of all editors can be configured to one of two modes:
<UL>
<LI>Rand-editor Mode (*)
<LI>vi/emacs/st80-editor Mode
</UL>
In "Rand-editor" mode, the window behaves like a piece of paper, where the text-cursor
can be positioned wherever you like, simply by clicking there.
If required, spaces are inserted.
<P>
In "vi-editor" mode, the cursor can only positioned to a place after an actual character.
If you click to the right of the last character in a line, the cursor will be placed
right after the last character in that line.
If you click below the last line, it will be positioned at the end of the text.
<P>

It is interesting to note that non-programmers usually find the "Rand-editor" behavior
more natural, whereas most programmers are used to the "unnatural" vi/emacs behavior.
<P>

You can change this setting in the launcher's settings dialog, under
"<I>Tools</I>" - "<I>Editor</I>" - "<I>ST80 cursor behavior at end of line</I>".

(*) the "Rand-editor, known as e" was a much advanced wysiwyg editor for glass-tube displays.
<br>It was quite popular in the 80's. (<A HREF="http://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/2006/N2239-1.pdf">http://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/2006/N2239-1.pdf</A>)
