<H1>Quick Start Guide</H1>

Hello, welcome to Smalltalk/X!
<P>
When <CITE>ST/X</CITE> is started initially,
it opens two windows for you:
the <I>Launcher</I> and a <i>System Workspace</i>
(in which you will probably read this text right now).
<br>The Launcher is your central place to open other Smalltalk tools and to display status information and
information messages.
<br>
Workspaces are little editor-like windows,
into which code can be typed for immediate evaluation.
Use it for code which is to be thrown away later,
not for writing code which is to be kept longer.
To extend or modify the system by writing new code,
or to write your own applications,
the <i>SystemBrowser</i> tool is used (which is described later).

<P>
Things you should do now:

<UL>
<LI>Read the <A HREF="getStart/quickIntro.html">"Show me what is Cool" introduction</A>
<LI>Read the <A HREF="getStart/TOP.html">"Detailed Getting Started" document</A>

<LI>Adjust the settings to your personal style
<DL>

<DT>
Look & Feel:
<DD>
    <CITE>ST/X</CITE> supports multple view styles, which more or less mimic
    existing Window Systems (Windows, Linux, Motif, Irix etc.).
    The view style can be changed via the Launcher's
<br>
	<I>"System" - "Settings" - "ViewStyle" - "Style"</I> - dialog.
<br>
    Currently, the prettiest styles are the <b>'mswindowsxp'</b>, <b>'mswindowsvista'</b>
    and <b>'adwaita'</b> styles
    - even for non Windows/Linux systems.
<br>If you are a nostalgic type and remember the 90s with their Silicon Graphics Workstations,
    try the <b>'sgMotif'</b> style (just kidding).
<P>

<DT>
  Font:
<DD>
	If you work a lot with non-latin1 characters (i.e. cyrillic, japanese etc.),
	select an appropriate unicode font (use the font-selection dialog from either the
	Launcher or via a TextView's popup menu). Notice that many unicode fonts do not
	include the full set of characters (look at the "Hello"-page to check).
<P>

<DT>
  Editor:
<DD>
	The editor's behavior can be adjusted in many ways. These settings are found
	in the Launcher's
<br>
	<I>"System" - "Settings" - "Tools" - "Editor"</I> - dialog.
<br>
	For example, tab stops can be changed to be either multiples of 4 or 8.
	All of <CITE>ST/X</CITE>'s source code uses a 4-spaces tab, so it is the recommended setting.
	Have a look at the other settings there too.
	Keyboard focus behavior (focus follows mouse) and some modifier key settings
	are adjusted in <I>"System" - "Settings" - "ViewStyle"</I>.
<P>

<DT>
Keyboard & Shurtcuts:
<DD>
    The default keyboard mapping is described in the <I>"Keyboard.wsp"</I> workspace.
    The Launcher's settings dialog also contains a page which displays (but does not
    allow to change) the current keyboard mapping.
    If you don't like it, have a look (and edit) the "<code>keyboard.rc</code>" file.
    This file is consulted at startup time and can also be reloaded after a change
    via the fileBrowser's "<I>fileIn</I>"-function.
<P>

<DT>
Language:
<DD>
    For lack of resources and language competence, only German, English and Spanish
    are fully supported. A lot of Chinese and some rudimentary French, Italian etc. are present,
    but definitely not complete.
    Notice, that some of the existing translations are only provided to give a hint
    on how it is done and to give editors something to start with
    (read <A NAME="BACK_BE_NICE" HREF="#BE_NICE>"be nice"</A> at the end).
    All language strings are found in the
	<CODE>"lib*/resources/*.rs"</CODE>-files;
    there you will find per-package translations for individual languages.
    Language files can be edited either in any unicode-aware editor,
    or the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> FileBrowser,
    or the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> language tool which is opened via the Launcher's "System"-menu.
<P>
    If you add or fix anything there, we would be very happy,
    if you'd send us your changes - we will incorporate them into the next release.
    Make sure that your chosen font is able to display those characters
    (especially if you edit Greek, Russian or a far-east language translations).
<P>
    Sorry: <CITE>ST/X</CITE> does not (yet) support right-to-left text display
    (i.e. Hebrew and Arabic). Be patient - maybe someone pays us to do it in the future.
<P>

<DT>
  Recommended:
<DD>
	After you have changed your preferences, be sure to save them (a file named "<code>settings.stx</code>" will be written).
	<B>Otherwise, the settings are only used for the current session</B>.
	Also, you should save a snapshot image (Launcher's <I>"File" - "Save Image"</I> menu)
	for faster startup the next time.
	You can always start <CITE>ST/X</CITE> with the "-I" command line argument to
	ignore the snapshot image and force a fresh start. Or, start with "-i &lt;fileName&gt;" to resume an
	older saved state.
</DL>
<LI>Learn to use some of the Tools.</LI>
  The most useful ones are:
<UL>
<LI>        <A HREF="tools/misc/TOP.html#WORKSPACE">Workspace</A>
<LI>        <A HREF="tools/newbrowser/TOP.html">SystemBrowser</A>
<LI>        <A HREF="tools/cbrowser/TOP.html">ChangesBrowser</A>
<LI>        <A HREF="tools/fbrowserV2/TOP.html">FileBrowser</A>
<LI>        <A HREF="tools/misc/TOP.html#INSPECTOR">Inspector</A>
</UL>
  Get used to them.
  As a beginner, please read the <A HREF="getStart/TOP.html">"Tutorial for Beginners"</A>
  in the online documentation. This describes enough of the tools and Smalltalk language for
  a smooth start.
<P>
  By the way: to reopen a window containing this text, open a workspace
  and select the <I>"New System Workspace"</I> item in its <I>"File"</I> menu.
  Alternatively, press the Launcher's workspace icon and wait for the pull down menu to appear
 (keep the button pressed).
<P>

<LI>Learn Smalltalk by writing little demo programs
<BR>  See the "Reading List" in the online documentation;
    we recommend reading Ivan Tomek's interactive
<A HREF="../../books/JoyOfST/IntroToST.html">"Introduction to ST"</A>.
  These documents can also be reached via the <I>"Help" - "ST/X Online Documentation"</I>-menu of the Launcher.
  Then proceed to the "Reading List" and have a look for the Programmer's Documentation.
<P>

<LI>Save your work
<BR>  Save a snapshot (Launcher's <I>"File" - "Save Image"</I>-menu) and/or fileOut your classes from
  time to time. Have a look at the ChangesBrowser, which is your life saver in case of
  desaster. For real work, you should set up a source code repository, and checkin classes there.
  The classic source code management system used with <CITE>ST/X</CITE> is CVS, but there is also support for Perforce,
  SVN and Mercurial. You can directly checkin/our classes from within the browser.
<P>

<LI>Communicate
<BR>  Talk to others - there is a very active Smalltalk community.
  See comp.lang.smalltalk, various Smalltalk related webSites and various mailing lists.
  We have also setup an <CITE>ST/X</CITE> specific forum at "forum.exept.de".
<P>

<LI><A HREF="#BACK_BE_NICE" NAME="BE_NICE>Be Nice</A>
<BR>    If you are able to provide translations for the UI (menu items, labels and strings),
	I would be very happy, if you'd sit down for an hour or so, type in the translations,
	for greek, russian, etc. and send me the result.
	See the files under the "<code>lib*/resources</code>" directories for how this is done, and what is missing.
	Even fragments will help - I'll merge them into the next release.
	Think about returning something this way - you get <CITE>ST/X</CITE> for free, so an hour or so
	should not be too much time to spend.
<P>

<LI> Don't Panic

<LI>Always
<BR><B>Have fun</B>
