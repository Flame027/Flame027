<H2>&sect; 1 Scope of License and Compensation</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	This agreement governs the use of the computer program Smalltalk/X,
	which, dependent of the version acquired by the user, full, evaluation,
	or non-commercial, consists of the components as listed in the version
	description, hereafter summarily designated as  SOFTWARE. The price
	is specified in the current valid price list of eXept Software AG,
	hereafter referred to as eXept.
	Excluded from the contract is any public domain software and freeware
	which is contained on the media.  These software components are provided
	to the user without cost and excluding any guarantee whatsoever.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	The SOFTWARE is permanently licensed to the user.
</DL>


<H2>&sect; 2 Copying Restrictions and Safeguarding</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user may copy the delivered program as long as the respective copying
	is necessary for the use of the program.  The necessary copying are the
	installation of the program from the original media to the media of the
	used hardware as well as loading the program into memory.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	In addition the user may make a copy for the backup purposes.  There may
	however be only one backup copy made and preserved at any given time.
	This backup copy is to be marked as such.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	By using suitable precautions, the user is obliged to prevent unauthorized
	third parties from gaining access to the program or the documentation.
	The original media as well as the backup copies are to be kept in a secure
	place.  The adherence to these contractual obligations is to be expressly
	pointed out to the  employees of the user.
<DT>(4)<DD>
	Additional copies, including the output of program code on the printer as
	also photocopies of the handbook, shall not be made by the user.  If the
	purchased version does not include a handbook, then the user has the right
	to make a copy by printing the program documentation.
</DL>


<H2>&sect; 3 Multiple Use and Use in a Network Environment</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user may install the software on any computer hardware that is available
	to him.  If however, the user changes computer hardware, he must delete the
	SOFTWARE from all media belonging to the hitherto utilized computer hardware.
	If the user disposes seperately of any media or apparatus containing the
	SOFTWARE, he will ensure that he has completely erased or otherwise destroyed
	any SOFTWARE contained on such media or stored in such apparatus.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	A concurrent loading of, saving on or use of the SOFTWARE in more than one
	independent computer hardware is forbidden.  The installation in a network is
	regulated in paragraph 3.  If the user wishes to concurrently utilize the
	SOFTWARE on more than one computer hardware, then he must acquire the licenses
	for the corresponding number of the SOFTWARE programming packages.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	The installation of the licensed SOFTWARE in a network or in another multi-user
	system is forbidden, as far as the possibility of concurrent multiple utilization
	is thereby created.  If the user wants to install the SOFTWARE in a network or in
	another multi-user system, he must prevent the concurrent multiple use through an
	access protection mechanism or tender eXept a special network license fee.  The
	size of the license fee depends on the number of users in the multi-user system.
	The user will be notified of the network fee to be paid in each individual case,
	as soon as eXept has been given notice of the planned network installation
	including the number of connected network users.  The installation in the network
	is only permitted after the complete payment of the network license fee.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 4 Transfer Restrictions</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user may transfer the SOFTWARE and all rights in the SOFTWARE granted to him
	in this agreement including the user handbook and accompanying materials to the
	transferee  provided that such transferee agrees in writing to accept the terms
	and conditions of this agreement.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	The user must preserve this agreement.  Before transferring the SOFTWARE, the user
	must  present the new user this agreement for the new users information.  Should
	the user not have this agreement in his possession at the time of the transfer,
	he is required to request a replacement copy from eXept.  The user bears the
	resulting shipping and handling  costs.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	In the case of a transfer of the SOFTWARE the user must give the transferee all
	SOFTWARE, including, if necessary, all backup copies, or destroy all non-transferred
	copies.  As a result of the transfer the rights and licenses granted to the user in
	this agreement expire.  The user has the obligation, as stated in §11 Paragraph 1 of
	this agreement, to inform eXept of the SOFTWARE transfer.
<DT>(4)<DD>
	The user may transfer the SOFTWARE and all rights in the SOFTWARE granted him in this
	agreement including the user handbook and accompanying materials to the transferee
	for a given period of time, i.e. renting, leasing, lending, provided that such
	transferee agrees in writing to accept the terms and conditions of this agreement.
	In the case of a transfer of the SOFTWARE for a period of time the user must give
	the transferee all SOFTWARE, including if need be all backup copies, or destroy
	all non-transferred copies.  As a result of the transfer of the SOFTWARE for the
	given period of time, the user forfeits for the said period the rights and licenses
	granted to him in this agreement.
<DT>(5)<DD>
	The user may not transfer the SOFTWARE either completely or for a period of time,
	if a well-founded suspicion exists, that the transferee will violate this agreement,
	especially produce unauthorized copies.  This applies also with regard to the
	employees of the user.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 5 Recompiling and Program Changes</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The decompilation of the SOFTWARE into another code form as well as the reverse
	engineering of the SOFTWARE including program changes are allowed for own use,
	especially with the aim of debugging or extending the scope of the SOFTWARE.
	For own use in the sense of this agreement is to be considered especially the
	private utilization by the user. In addition, for own use is also considered to
	be the professional or for-gainful-employment utilization as long as the
	utilization is limited to utilization by the user and his employees and is not
	utilized externally in any commercial manner.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	The removal of copy protection or similar protection routines is only allowed,
	if the protection mechanism limits or hinders the error free utilization of the
	program.  The user bears the burden of proof for the limitation or hinderness
	of the error free use due to the protection mechanism.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	Commercial third parties, which are in a potential competitive relationship to
	the supplier, may carry out the corresponding acts in the sense of paragraphs
	1 and 2 of this agreement, only if the supplier will not carry the desired
	program changes for a suitable remuneration.  The supplier shall be given an
	adequate appointed time to scrutinize the mandate.
<DT>(4)<DD>
	In the case the forenamed acts shall be carried out for commercial reasons,
	then they are only allowed if they are essential for the production, maintenance
	or the functioning of an independently produced interoperable program and the
	necessary information was not published or otherwise accessible.
<DT>(5)<DD>
	Proprietary and copyright notices, serial numbers as well as legends shall not
	in any case be removed or changed.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 6 Guarantee</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	eXept guarantees a program, which is useful in sense of the program description.
	Defects in the delivered SOFTWARE including the handbooks and other material
	will be rectified by the supplier inside of the guarantee period of six (6)
	months after the corresponding notification by the user.  This takes place by
	the choice of the supplier whether the rectification occurs through a free
	repair or through a replacement.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	If the defect cannot be rectified inside of a suitable period or if it appears
	that the repair or substitution fails for whatever reason, the user can demand
	a  fee reduction or contract annulment.   The failure of the repair or
	substitution proceeds from the point, at which the supplier has had sufficient
	time for repairing or for substitution without the desired success being reached,
	at which repair or substitution is impossible, at which the supplier refuses or
	unacceptably delays, or at which justifiable doubt exists about the chance of
	success.
</DL>


<H2>&sect; 7 Guarantee Expiration</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The guarantee expires, if and in so far as the user changes components or
	combines components in a way which is not foreseen or described in the documentation.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	If it turns out within the framework of a repair, that the occurring failure
	results from acts as described in paragraph 1, eXept is required to inform
	the user thereof without delay.  The user bears the hereby resulting costs.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 8 Duty of Examination and Reproof</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user is required to examine the delivered SOFTWARE for obvious defects
	which would attract the attention of an average user without further ado.
	Obvious failures, especially missing media or handbooks as well as substantial,
	easily seen damage to the media, are to be registered with eXept in writing
	within two weeks of the date of delivery.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	Failures, which are not obvious, must be registered with eXept in writing
	within two weeks of the perception of the failure. The failure and especially
	the occurring symptoms are to be documented to the best of the users ability.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	In the case of a violation of the duty of examination and reproof the guarantee
	expires with respect to the failure in question.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 9 Ownership of the Software and Media</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user agrees and acknowledges that eXept transfers no ownership interest
	in the SOFTWARE, in the intellectual property in any SOFTWARE or in any
	SOFTWARE copy, to the user under this agreement or otherwise, and that eXept
	and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to the user
	hereunder. The user owns the media on which the SOFTWARE was originally
	provided to the user hereunder and on which the user subsequently copies
	the SOFTWARE, but eXept and its licensors shall retain ownership of all
	SOFTWARE or portions thereof embodied in or on such media.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	eXept reserves the ownership of the media, which was delivered to the user,
	until the complete payment of all outstanding debts at the time of delivery
	or later occurring debts, which occur due to this contractual software
	license agreement.  In the case of payment with a check or draft payment,
	then until their clearance.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	In the case of the user being in arrears, then the assertion of the
	reservation of the right of ownership by the supplier does not mean a
	retirement of the contract unless eXept explicitly informs the user of such.
</DL>


<H2>&sect;  10 Limitation of Liability</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	For damage due to defect of title and missing promised qualities eXept has
	unlimited liability.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	Damage claims due to an active violation of the requirements, fault at the
	closing of the contract, or unlawful action against eXept or its legal
	representative are excluded so long as this damage is not caused by deliberate,
	willful, or truly negligent action on the part of eXept or its legal representative.
	This does not include claims in tort due to promised qualities or functionality,
	which should protect the customer against the risk of successive of following damages.
	If the user is a legal entity, for whom the SOFTWARE is used to operate its
	business, then the claims of replacement of such damages is limited to those
	which are normally calculated to occur with the installation or use of this SOFTWARE.
<DT>(3)<DD>
	If it occurs, that the user of the licensed SOFTWARE suffers the loss of data,
	eXept is liable for the occurring damage only as long as the user backed up and
	archived his data in intervals and methods, which were adequate for the application,
	so that this can be reconstructed within an economically justifiable expense.
</DL>


<H2>&sect;   11 Duty of Notification</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	The user is required in the case of a transfer of the SOFTWARE to inform
	eXept in writing of the full name and address of the transferee.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	Inasmuch as it is a question of licensed SOFTWARE which is especially
	adapted for the users computer hardware with a buying price of more than
	DM 5.000,00, then the user is required to inform eXept in writing of a
	change in the computer hardware inside of the warranty period or during
	the existence of a maintenance contract.  The same is true in the case
	where the user wants to install the SOFTWARE in a network environment.
</DL>

<H2>&sect; 12 In Writing</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	Changes or extensions to this software license agreement, especially those
	transcending the normal settlements as well as promises or agreements may

	agreement shall be in any force whatsoever unless made in writing and
	signed by each party.
</DL>


<H2>&sect; 13 In General</H2>
<DL>
<DT>(1)<DD>
	As a rider to this software license agreement the general terms of business
	of eXept are in force.  These can be seen in the offices of eXept and will
	be sent to the user on demand.
<DT>(2)<DD>
	If any provision of this agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any
	reason, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining
	provisions of the agreement, and the parties will substitute for the invalid
	provision a valid provision which most closely approximates the intent and
	economic effect of the invalid provision.
