</CODE></PRE>
Agenda:
<BR>
<DL>
<DT>1) shared libraries (DLLs)
<DD>shared library support depends on the system to support
reentrant position independent code; most systems using ELF support this.
<BR>
With shared libraries, all classes code is shared by all running
Smalltalk applications. Without shared libraries, code is only shared between
processes which execute the same program. (i.e. the same executable).
<BR>
The standard Smalltalk executable is shared in any case, since UNIX automatically
shares the memory when multiple programs execute the same program text.
<P>

<DT>2) dynamic loading of machine code
<DD>if supported, compiled classes and/or classlibraries (so called packages)
can be loaded into the executable without a need to leave the environment.
<BR>
On systems which do not support this, you have to leave Smalltalk,
build a new executable (i.e. relink Smalltalk) and restart in that new
environment.
<P>

<DT>3) incremental compilation to machine code
<DD>if supported, primitive code can be entered and accepted in the browser
and are immediately available for execution.
<BR>
If not supported, primitive code can be entered, but the system
creates a non executable stub method, which traps into the debugger
if ever executed. For real compilation, the method has to be compiled using
the stc batch compiler and the system relinked and restarted as described above.
<P>

<DT>4) 3D GL graphics support
<DD>on most systems, a subset of the GL functionality is implemented
by use of the VGL graphics library which implements a GL subset.
This subset does not support light sources, z-buffering, textures.
On SGI machines, an interface to the full set of GL graphics is provided.
<BR>
OpenGL support is either implemented by a vendor-provided openGL library
(SGI and Windows systems) or via the MESA graphics package, which is
reasonably compatible to openGL.
<P>

<DT>5) Xt widget support
<DD>on most systems, wrapper classes and helpers to include Xt widgets
are provided. Xt support is not maintained and provided "as-is".
<P>

<DT>... - to be validated
<DD>currently being developed/verified/tested.
The feature is not officially released for that architecture.
<P>

<DT>*yes - provided "as-is"
<DD>this feature works partially, but NeXTStep may have trouble unloading
dynamically loaded code.
The feature is not officially released/maintained for that architecture.
<P>
<DT>??? - to be validated
<DD>currently being developed/verified/tested.
The feature is not officially released for that architecture.

Agenda:
<PRE>

u  ....... untested
// ....... non-existing or useless configuration
(1) ...... you should use a StaticGray mode instead
</PRE>

With 8-bit Pseudocolor displays, image display may lead to ugly output, due to
running out of available colors while showing images. You may get better results
by using a fix color palette (for example: a 6x6x4 palette).
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../icons/win95.gif">
<IMG SRC="../../icons/winNT.gif">
<BR>
As of version 3.4.x, the windows platforms are only usable with
16bit or 24bit TrueColor display modes.
8bit display mode will be added later.
<BR>
We do not plan to support 4bit or monochrome displays in the future.


<H2><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="DISPLAYNOTES">Display specific notes</A></H2>

The following section describes display specific information.


<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="DISPLAY_MONOCHROME">Monochrome and 16-color displays</A></H3>

Although still present in the code and configuration files,
monochrome and 16color (old EGA) displays are no longer officially
supported. We will continue to test <CITE>ST/X</CITE> against such systems,
but will not guarantee that all such systems work reasonable.



<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="DISPLAY_EXCEED">Exceed</A></H3>

<H4>Keyboard</H4>

The Exceed X-Server (on a Windows-95/NT box),
catches <KBD>"<B>ALT</B>"</KBD>-key combinations and does not deliver events for
them to the X-client. Therefore, all shortkey-commands mapped to
<KBD>"<B>CMD-x</B>"</KBD> (which is the left <KBD>"<B>ALT</B>"</KBD>-key) do not work in the base configuration.
<BR>
(can Exceed be reconfigured ?)
<P>
As a fix, an exceed specific configuration file (<CODE>"d_exceed.rc"</CODE>)
is provided, which maps those functions to corresponding CTRL-key
combinations.
<BR>
The interrupt key (normally <KBD>"<B>CTRL-c</B>"</KBD>) is remapped to the
<KBD>"<B>PAUSE</B>"</KBD> key.
<P>
Thus, under exceed, the shortKeys are:
<PRE>
  <KBD>CTRL-c</KBD>    <VAR>copy</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-x</KBD>    <VAR>cut</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-v</KBD>    <VAR>paste</VAR>

  <KBD>CTRL-a</KBD>    <VAR>accept</VAR>

  <KBD>CTRL-d</KBD>    <VAR>doIt</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-p</KBD>    <VAR>printInt</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-i</KBD>    <VAR>inspectIt</VAR>

  <KBD>CTRL-s</KBD>    <VAR>search</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-f</KBD>    <VAR>search again forward</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-b</KBD>    <VAR>search again backward</VAR>

  <KBD>CTRL-g</KBD>    <VAR>goto line</VAR>

  <KBD>CTRL-f</KBD>   <VAR>page forward</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-b</KBD>   <VAR>page backward</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-d</KBD>   <VAR>half page forward</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-u</KBD>   <VAR>half page backward</VAR>

  <KBD>PAUSE</KBD>   <VAR>interrupt window process & open debugger</VAR>
  <KBD>CTRL-y</KBD>   <VAR>interrupt window process & abort operation</VAR>
</PRE>
Some shortKeys are lost with this setup, though.
<BR>
You may like to edit your own <CODE>"d_exceed.rc"</CODE>
if you don't like this setup.

<H4>Window redraw while resizing or moving</H4>

Under Exceed, views do not get informed while being moved
or resized - until the move or resize operation is finished.
<BR>
Therefore, no redrawing will take place.
<BR>
This is an Exceed limitation - not an ST/X bug.



<H2><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCHNOTES">Architecture specific notes</A></H2>

The following section describes architecture specific information.

<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_64">64bit Support</A></H3>

64bit versions are available for the X86_64 and the Digital Alpha CPUs.
These will store integers of up to 63 bits in a single pointer,
thus possibly showing slightly better Integer arithmetic performance.
<P>
Of course, the main advantage is the much bigger object memory space
available.


<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_ALPHA">Digital Alpha CPU</A></H3>

On the alpha, <CITE>ST/X</CITE> uses 64bit object pointers and 63 bit integers;
this results in somewhat added memory overhead, due to a larger average object
size (since all pointers are twice as long) and somewhat more CPU overhead,
since in many cases twice the
amount of data has to be moved as compared to 32 bit systems.
<BR>
Also, the code size (both static and JIT-generated) may be larger,
since constant pointers may now require a 3-instruction load sequence
<BR>
(although the JIT translator tries hard to generate its code into the lower 32bit space,
 to avoid this).
<P>
On the other hand, some integer arithmetic is faster, since many operations
are now possible without leaving the SmallInteger range (which is now 63bit).

<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_X86_64">X86_64 CPU</A></H3>
Both 32bit and 64bit versions are available.
The 64bit version requires more memory and may be slightly slower than
the 32bit version (for reasons described above).



<H3><A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_VMS">OpenVMS</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="ARCH_VMS_RMS">RMS Filetypes</A></H3>

By default, all files as created by <CITE>ST/X</CITE> will have sequential-streamLF record format.
<BR>
The <CODE>FileStream</CODE> class provides an additional entry (#openWithMode:attributes:),
which allows the record
format to be specified as described in the RTL-Documentation of the <CODE>"creat"</CODE>
call.
To access existing non-stream files,
you may want to create a subclass of <CODE>FileStream</CODE> and redefine the instance
creation method(s) to specify appropriate attributes.
<BR>
However, be aware that such a class will not work as expected on other systems.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="ARCH_VMS_SEEK">Positioning of non stream files</A></H3>

Positioning within a file is not possible on an arbitrary byte boundary with some
record formats. For example, a file with a variable-record-format may only be positioned
to the beginning, the end or to a record boundary.
<BR>
For those formats, <CITE>ST/X</CITE> positions the stream by re-reading all of the file from the
beginning - which may be slow for big files.
<BR>
Make certain, that your <CITE>ST/X</CITE> sourcefiles are converted from this format
to streamCR format; otherwise, a performance penalty is to be payed when the browser
accesses those and seeks to a methods source position.


<H3>
<IMG SRC="../../icons/win95.gif">
<IMG SRC="../../icons/winNT.gif">
<BR>
<A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS">Windows-95 / Windows-NT</A></H3>

Windows-95, Windows-98 and Windows-XP are no longer supported.
Please contact exept, if you need ST/X on any of them.

<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_INTERRUPTS">Interrupting a runaway primitive</A></H4>

Since both Windows-NT and Windows-95 have no concept of an interrupting
signal, there exists no satisfying mechanism to interrupt runaway
primitive code (i.e. endless loops).
<BR>
Although, <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> allows such code to be halted and inspected
in the debugger AND it is possible to resume or terminate such a
halted process, it is NOT possible to abort or terminate
such a process in a <B>clean</B> way (i.e. with unwind blocks evaluated).
<BR>
The reason is that the CTRL-C break is executed by a different
OS-thread on Windows systems, and there is no provision provided
to "push an interrupt context" onto a suspended threads context
from another thread.
<P>
The result is that the stopped process can only be resumed or hard
terminated - it will NOT perform its
unwind or cleanup actions, when terminated; and it is not possible to
unwind its stack and make it resume somewhere higher in the method
calling hierarchy.
<BR>
Notice, that the above only applies to endless looping primitive code -
both primitive standard File-I/O operations and looping Smalltalk code can be
interrupted as usual.


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_STACK">Dynamic stack grow</A></H4>

Since the Win32 version of <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> maps each of
its processes onto a native thread,
and Windows-95 performs some obscure (undocumented and braindamaged)
stack validations in most API calls, all stack must be preallocated
and the Spaghetti-Stack mechanism as used with the Unix versions
cannot be used.
<BR>
The effect is that a process cannot resize its stack in a stackOverflow
exception handler.


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_APICALLS">Blocking API calls</A></H4>

All API calls are (supposed to be) non blocking.
Other Smalltalk threads continue to execute.
To ensure that, blocking API calls are
executed by a separate thread,
and the Smalltalk thread waits for it to complete.
For this, all API- and external library calls
have to be wrapped into a macro, which implements the interaction with
the API-call thread.
<P>
Please send us a bug report if we forgot to wrap an API call
correctly and made it blocking.
<P>
If you encounter problems with a blocking API call, and ST/X does no
longer respond, press CTRL-C twice in the ST/X-console window,
which should bring you into the miniDebugger, where a C-continue
command should resume execution (although, the thread which did the blocking
call will be halted).


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_DISPLAY">Display configuration</A></H4>

The Windows graphics interface (currently) always
uses 24bit colors and ignores any color palette.
<P>
Notice: The folowing is no longer a problem these days.
<p>
This works in all
display modes (i.e. also in 16- and 256-color modes), but may
lead to ugly color dithering when certain colors are drawn
in 16 color or 256 color modes.
<BR>
For best results, please use either a 16bit hiColor or a 24bit trueColor
display mode with <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE>.
<BR>
The windows view-style itself uses the colors as configured
in the Preference Panel - therefore, this mode should also
look reasonable in 16- and 256 color modes.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_REDRAW_BUGS">Redraw bugs</A></H4>

When moving non-STX windows over an ST?X view, garbage (blank) areas are
sometimes left, which are not correctly redrawn. This does not happen,
if other ST/X views are moved (probably some thread-locking error ?)


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_XDISPLAY">X-Display under Win32</A></H4>

The Windows version allows for both a local windows display and
a remote X11-display to be used.
To use an X11-display, start <CODE>"stx"</CODE> with the environment
variable <CODE>"DISPLAY"</CODE> being set to your X displays name,
i.e., in a command window, execute:
<CODE><PRE>
    SET DISPLAY=myDisplay:0
    stx
</PRE></CODE>
<BR>
<CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> will use the local display if that shell variable is either not
set, or a connection to that display cannot be established.
<P>
It is even possible to run <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> in multihead configurations,
where both a local native display and multiple remote X displays
are handled concurrently.
<BR>
(read the documentation in the DeviceWorkstation class on how to
 setup multiple display operation)


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_BADIMPL">Partial implemented (buggy) features</A></H4>
<UL>
<LI>the terminal view does not work perfectly
<BR>(especially cursor positioning)
<LI>the shell-terminal-view ('command.com-view) does not work under Win-NT
<BR>(funny: it works under Win95 - seems to be one of the rare situations, where Win95
behaves nicer than Win-NT ;-)
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_DRAWING">Limited drawing capabilities of Windows-95</A></H4>

Windows-95 does not support all drawing styles (or style combinations):
this includes:
<UL>
<LI>masked drawing / filling with big patterns
<BR>
Only patterns of size 8@8 are supported under Windows-95
<P>
<LI>non-Solid wide-lines
<BR>
Non-Solid lineStyles are only supported with thin lines (i.e. lineWidth==1)
<P>
<LI>non-solid lines with mask
<BR>
Masks are only supported with solid lines under Windows-95
</UL>
<P>
We do not plan to add workaround code, since we expect
those bugs to be fixed in upcoming windows releases.
<BR>
(You should probably use Windows-NT, anyway - or use a real OS ;-)


<H3>

<BR>
<A HREF="#INDEX" NAME="ARCH_OSX">Mac-OSX</A></H3>


<H4><A NAME="ARCH_WINDOWS_INTERRUPTS">X Display Only</A></H4>

There is currently no support for native Carbon or Cocoa display services.
<CITE>ST/X</CITE> uses the X window system (XQuartz) for display.
This must be installed before running <CITE>ST/X</CITE>.
<P>
Some limitations result from this:
<UL>
<LI>Inconvenient default keyboard mapping
<BR>this affects mostly the CMD-key handling and some CTRL-key compinations,
which are used by the Mac desktop for diferent functions.
<CITE>ST/X</CITE> uses the left ALT key as a CMD-key replacement.
You may change the xmodmap keyboard mappings to fix this.
<P>

<LI>No access to the screen bitmap
<BR>Screen readout functions and screen drawing is not implemented properly
in the Apple X-Server implementation.
This means that icon dragging from an
<CITE>ST/X</CITE> window over the desktop is not drawn (invisible).
<P>

<LI>No top-level menu
<BR>The application menu is not supported, and the XQuartz menu
is always shown for any ST/X window.
