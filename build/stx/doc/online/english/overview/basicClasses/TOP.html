<P>
This section will give you a rough overview of which basic classes
are of interest to start with. To get more detailed info on many others not
listed here, read any standard textbook on smalltalk. Also, the
<A HREF="../../tools/sbrowser/TOP.html">systemBrowser</A> should
be used to investigate these in detail.
<P>
Detailed information on individual classes is found in the
<A HREF="../../classDoc/TOP.html">class documentation</A>,
where links to all classes are found, both grouped by function
and by name.


<H1>Basic classes</H1>
<P>
The basic class library consists of classes which are not related to
the graphical user interface or development system.
These classes will almost always be needed for any type of
application. Of course, the <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> environment itself is
built on top of these classes.
<P>
The classes have been modeled to behave as described in the
<A HREF="../literature.html#[1]"><CITE>Blue Book [1]</CITE></A>.
They will also conform to the upcoming
<A HREF="../literature.html#[6]"><CITE>ANSI Smalltalk Language Standard [6]</CITE></A>.
<P>
The basic class library consists (among many others) of:
<UL>
<LI> <A NAME="I_COLLECTIONS" HREF="collections.html">collections</A>
<LI> <A NAME="I_STREAMS" HREF="streams.html">streams</A>
<LI> <A NAME="I_NUMERIC" HREF="numeric.html">numeric classes</A>
<LI> <A NAME="I_PROCESS" HREF="process.html">process support</A>
and
<A NAME="I_EXCEPTIONS" HREF="exceptions.html">exception handling</A>
<LI> <A NAME="I_PROCESS" HREF="misc.html">other useful classes</A>
<LI> <A NAME="I_CLASSES" HREF="classes.html">class and metaclass</A> protocol
</UL>
<P>
The smalltalk source code of all of these classes is available and
delivered with the system. However, for production code, only the
binary class library needs to be delivered. Both static and dynamic versions
of this library can be generated (on systems that support dynamic shared
libraries - of course).
