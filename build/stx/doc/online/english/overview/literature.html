<BR>Written by Adele Goldberg and David Robson, this is the definitive
reference for the smalltalk language - a must in every library.

<DT> <A NAME = "[2]">[2]</A>&nbsp;
<CITE>Smalltalk-80, the language</CITE>
<DD> also known as "the Purple Book".
A new edition of [1] with some updates but also omissions (implementations,
as the title suggests).
<BR>

We recommend, having eiher the blue or purple book at hand.

<DT> <A NAME = "[3]">[3]</A>&nbsp;
<CITE>Smalltalk-80, the interactive programming envronment</CITE>
<DD> written by Adele Goldberg, also known as "the Orange Book".
Describes the user interface as in the original Xerox smalltalk implementation.
Not up-to-date, but basic concepts of the programming environment
are still as described in this book.

<DT> <A NAME = "[4]">[4]</A>&nbsp;
<CITE>Smalltalk-80, bits of history words of advice</CITE>
<DD> also known as "the Green Book".
Some nice-to-read background information on the history and internals of
early smalltalk implementations.
Not up-to-date, many new research results make some of the articles obsolete.

<DT> <A NAME = "[5]">[5]</A>&nbsp;
<CITE>The design and evaluation of a high performance smalltalk system</CITE>
<DD> written by David Michael Unger, this book describes many techniques
which are also used in <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> (and other modern smalltalk
implementations).
Particularly, the description of generation scavenging garbage collection,
inline caching and lazy evaluation of contexts are valuable.
This is not a book to learn smalltalk, but a good resource
for implementation details.

<DT> <A NAME = "[7]">[7]</A>&nbsp;
<CITE>Inside Smalltalk volume 1</CITE>
<DD> written by Wilf R. LaLonde & John R. Pugh.
<BR> 
although being outdated somewhat (since it describes an old version of Smalltalk-80),
this book is still a good reference on the smalltalk language and class library.
Especially, the basic classes (collections, streams, numeric classes etc.)
are described in much detail.

<CITE><A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~ducasse/WebPages/FreeBooks.html">Stefane Ducasse's list of free Smalltalk books</A></CITE>
<DD> many thanks to Stef for maintaining this list,
and to the authors & publishers for making these books
avalable for free on the net.
<BR>
Here are some of these books - for those without access to the web:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="../../../books/ALittleSmalltalk/ALittleSmalltalk.pdf">A Little Smalltalk</A> by Tim Budd</CITE>
<BR>
Describes Tim Budds "Little Smalltalk" system. Although Little Smalltalk can be regarded as a subset of
<CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> - the text is still worth reading as an introduction to Smalltalks concepts.
<BR>
However, any information on object internals, the programming environment or GUI are not valid for <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> 
or other smalltalk systems.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../../../books/ArtOfSmalltalk/artMissing186187Fix1.pdf">The Art and Science of Smalltalk</A> by Simon Lewis</CITE>
Uses ViusalWorks for examples - however, most of it also applies unchanged to <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE>.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../../../books/PracticalSmalltalk/PracticalSmalltalk.pdf">Practical Smalltalk using Smalltalk/V</A> by Dan Shafer & Dean A. Ritz</CITE>
Uses Smalltalk/V, which is somewhat different from VisualWorks and <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE>.

<LI> <A HREF="../../../books/SmalltalkAndOO/Smalltalk-and-OO.pdf">Smalltalk and Object Orientation - an Introduction</A> by John Hunt</CITE>
