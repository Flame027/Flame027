<H1>Editing Text</H1>


<H2>Selections</H2>

Text is selected using the left mouse button:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
press the button over the first character to be
selected,
<BR>
while being pressed, move the mouse pointer to the
end position
<BR>
release the mouse button.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The current selection will be highlighted. Pressing the
left mouse button again makes the system forget the
old selection and start a new one, except when you
press the <KBD>SHIFT</KBD> key while pressing the button.
<BR>
In this case, the current selection will be expanded.
You can expand a selection at any time, even if you
leave and reenter the view containing the selection.
It is therefore possible, to scroll the view (using
the scrollbar) or perform any other function (page up
or page down) needed to make the desired end position
visible. A selection can be expanded in both directions,
any number of times.
<P>
It is also possible to move the mouse pointer out of
the view, <STRONG>while</STRONG> the mouse button is being pressed. The
view will then start to automatically scroll. The farther
away you move the pointer from the views border, the
faster will it scroll. This is the easiest way of selecting
text: just let it scroll by and stop when the end position
arrives.
<P>
Double click will select wordwise, while triple click will select
linewise. If you keep the button pressed after such a multi-click and start to move,
it will go on selecting wordwise or linewise.
<P>
A quadruple click selects the whole text.

<H2><A NAME="POPUPMENU">Popup Menu Functions</A></H2>

All views showing text offer the usual
edit functions via a pop-up-menu,
which is activated with the right mouse button.
<BR>

<H2>Keyboard Shortcut Functions</H2>
Most functions of the popup menus are also available via
keyboard shortcuts. Actually, some functions are only available via
the keyboard. In general, keyboard functions are activated by pressing
either the <KBD>Control</KBD> or the <KBD>Command</KBD> key along with
another key. Depending on your keyboard, the keys may also be labeled
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> or <KBD>META</KBD> respectively.
On some keyboards, the <KBD>Command</KBD> key is labeled <KBD>ALT</KBD>.
<P>
Typically, all <KBD>CTRL</KBD> functions perform cursor positioning
functions, while the <KBD>CMD</KBD> functions modify the text or the
current selection (but there are a few exceptions to this).
<P>
<H3>Additional Functions to Select Text</H3>
<DL>
<DT><KBD>CMD-SHIFT-'A'</KBD>
<DD><I>select all</I>
<BR>
selects the whole text from the very first line to the very last line.
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'w'</KBD>
<DD><I>select word</I>
<BR>
selects the word under the cursor. If there is blank space under
the cursor, all space between the surrounding words or
to either end of the current line is selected.
Thus, to join two text lines, select the space at the line end and
<CODE>cut</CODE> it.
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'m'</KBD>
<DD><I>select matching</I>
<BR>
selects the text delimited by matching parenthesis. If the cursor is currently
positioned on any <KBD>'('</KBD>, <KBD>'['</KBD> or <KBD>'{'</KBD>-character,
the corresponding closing parenthesis is found forward in the text,
and all text between those including
the parenthesises is selected.
Likewise, if the cursor is positioned on a closing
parenthesis, the search is backward for the corresponding opening parenthesis.
<BR>
If no matching parenthesis is found, or the nesting is corrupted,
no selection is made.
<P>
<DT><KBD>ESC</KBD>
<DD>select from the
beginning of the line up to
the current cursor position. (See below for the definition of
<A HREF="#DOIT"><I>doIt</I></A>;
to evaluate
something in a workspace, you have to press two keys only:
<KBD>ESC</KBD> followed by <KBD>CMD-'d'</KBD>.)
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="EDITING">Editing</A></H3>

<P>
command key functions:
<DL>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'x'</KBD>
<DD><I>cut</I>
<BR>
the selected text is deleted from the text and put into the Cut&amp;Paste buffer
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'c'</KBD>
<DD><I>copy</I>
<BR>
the selected text is copied into the Cut&amp;Paste buffer
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'v'</KBD>
<DD><I>paste</I>
<BR>
the contents of the Cut&amp;Paste buffer is inserted at the
current cursor position. If there is currently a
selection,
the selected text will be replaced. Notice that making
selections in other (non Smalltalk) views may also put
the selection into this Cut&amp;Paste buffer. Therefore, it
is possible to select some text in an xterm window and
paste it into some Smalltalk view. In contrast to
Smalltalk views, most X views automatically perform the <KBD>copy</KBD>
function when text is selected.
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'s'</KBD>
<DD><I>search</I>
<BR>
open up a panel to start a string search
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'f'</KBD>
<DD><I>forward search</I>
<BR>
search forward for the next
occurrence of the selection or last search string.
Ring the bell, (and show a cross-cursor for a
moment)
if not found.
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'b'</KBD>
<DD><I>backward search</I>
<BR>
same as above, but search backward.
</DL>
<P>
Some keyboards (for example on Sun workstations) provide
function keys labeled <KBD>"<B>copy</B>"</KBD>, <KBD>"<B>cut</B>"</KBD>,
<KBD>"<B>paste</B>"</KBD> and so on. These keys will usually also
perform the expected functions.

<H3>Control Key Functions for Cursor Positioning</H3>

<DL>
<DT><KBD>Ctrl-'a'</KBD>
<DD><I>start of line</I>
<BR>
position the cursor to the begin of the current line
<P>
<DT><KBD>Ctrl-'e'</KBD>
<DD><I>end of line</I>
<BR>
position the cursor to the end of the current line
<P>
<DT><KBD>Ctrl-'m'</KBD>
<DD><I>match</I>
<BR>
position the cursor on the matching parenthesis.
Ring the bell if none is found or if the parenthesis
nesting is wrong.
<P>
<DT><KBD>SHIFT-RETURN</KBD>
<DD><I>non inserting cursor return</I>
<BR>
moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line, but does not
insert a line break.
<P>
<DT><KBD>SHIFT-TAB</KBD>
<DD><I>non inserting tabulator</I>
<BR>
moves the cursor to the next tabulator position, but does not
insert a tabulator.
<P>
<DT><KBD>HOME</KBD>
<DD><I>home</I>
<BR>
move the cursor to the very beginning of the text
<P>
<DT><KBD>END</KBD>
<DD><I>end</I>
<BR>
move the cursor to the very end of the text
<P>
<DT><KBD>PAGEUP</KBD>
<DD><I>next page</I>
<BR>
scroll backward to make the previous page visible. A page is usually
the number of visible lines in the view.
<P>
<DT><KBD>PAGEDOWN</KBD>
<DD><I>previous page</I>
<BR>
scroll forward to make the next page visible. A page is usually
the number of visible lines in the view.
<P>
</DL>
<H3><A NAME="EXECUTING">Executing Smalltalk Expressions</A></H3>
<P>
The following additional keyboard commands are available in all views
which show code (i.e. in Workspaces and the Browser's code view):
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="DOIT"><KBD>CMD-'d'</KBD></A>
<DD><I>doIt</I>
<BR>
the selected text is evaluated as a Smalltalk expression
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'p'</KBD>
<DD><I>printIt</I>
<BR>
the selected text is evaluated as a Smalltalk expression
and the result inserted as new selection (so that
a simple cut will remove this new text).
<P>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'i'</KBD>
<DD><I>inspectIt</I>
<BR>
the selected text is evaluated as a Smalltalk
expression, and an Inspector is started on
the result.
</DL>

<H3>Saving Code/Text; Compiling</H3>
<P>

The following are available in the FileBrowser and SystemBrowser:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><KBD>CMD-'a'</KBD>
<DD><I>accept</I>
<BR>
the whole text (not just the selection) will
replace the old text. The actual function performed by this depends
on the context in which it is executed; for example in a FileBrowser,
the (modified) text will be saved back to the disk file.
In a SystemBrowser, the current method or class definition will be
re-compiled and installed. In other applications, different interpretations
of <I>accepting</I> may be used.
</DL>
<P>
There are even more functions, see the methods <CODE>keyPress:...</CODE>
in <CODE>TextView</CODE> and subclasses, especially <CODE>EditTextView</CODE>.
You can also easily add more functions there.
<P>
All keyboard functions are bound to their key by use of a mapping table,
called the <I>KeyboardMap</I>. The definition of the this map is done during
early startup from within the <CODE>"display.rc"</CODE> file.
You can change the mapping and/or add new keyboard functions there.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice, that you can define your private <CODE>"display.rc"</CODE> file
or use the default. The system uses the default file
(in <CODE>"/usr/lib/smalltalk"</CODE>
or <CODE>"/usr/local/lib/smalltalk"</CODE>)
if you don't have a private one.
<BR>
A private version can be put into your current directory or
<CODE>"~/.smalltalk</CODE>". (where <CODE>'~'</CODE> is the name of your home directory).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Sorry: currently there is no <KBD>undo</KBD> function, however
no change in the text will have any effect until you
accepted the new text.
