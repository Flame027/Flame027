Subject: OOP/Smalltalk Humor

A friend at apple tells an anecdote of a presentation that someone from
[creator of PASCAL] Wirth's research project LILITH was giving at Apple.

LILITH is a "dynamic" programming environment.  Like it's got browsers and
classes and instances and inspectors and interpreted-like class definitions
and looks a lot like the smalltalk environment does.

At the end of the talk, someone from the audience stands up and asks
something to this effect:

>> -- You claim your system is object-oriented
>>
>>      -- Yes
>>
>> -- but it doesn't have late binding
>>
>>      -- right
>>
>> -- and it doesn't have garbage collection
>>
>>      -- right
>>
>> -- and it doesn't have ...
>>
>> and he goes on to accuse the system of not having a lot of the
>> things that Smalltalk has.
>>
>> -- then it's not really object-oriented after all, is it?
>>
>>      -- well, who's to say what object-oriented is?
>>
>> -- I am.   I'm Alan Kay, and I coined the term.
