Sorry,
<P>
online <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> documentation,
which is generated just in time from your running system,
can only be displayed with the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> document viewer.
<P>
If you have the builtIn webServer enabled in your
running <CITE>ST/X</CITE>  system, try this link:
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/ClassDoc">http://localhost:8080/ClassDoc</A>.
<BR>
If not, start one via the "<I>Settings</I>"-"<I>Communications</I>"-"<I>HTTPServer</I>" Dialog,
in your running Smalltalk and try again.
<P>
Or else, if all of the above fails or you are not inside a Smalltalk IDE,
try the service provided by eXept via
<A HREF="http://live.exept.de:8080/ClassDoc">http://live.exept.de:8080/ClassDoc</A>.
This service generates documents for of its currently executing version,
which may be somewhat outdated, but better than nothing...
