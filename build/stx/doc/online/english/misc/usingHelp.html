<H2><A NAME="INTODUCTION" HREF="#I_INTODUCTION">Introduction</A></H2>

The complete Smalltalk/X online documentation is provided in HTML format.
As such, it can be viewed with any web browser, such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari or Opera.
<P>
However, the documents also contain interactive code execution features, which
requires direct communication with the running Smalltalk system.
A feature which was
not at all possible at times when the ST/X documentation was initially written (mid 90's,
when JavaScript was not even invented).
Therefore, we wrote our own implementation of an <A HREF="../tools/htmlViewer/TOP.html">HTML renderer</A>,
which supported what was more or less state of the art at that time.
As we do not plan to go into the browser business,
and the documentation viewer fullfills
our needs for online manual presentation,
we did not and don't plan to put more effort into further development of the viewer.
Therefore, it might look a bit outdated and also does not support all
those fancy new features (stylesheets, for example).
It also has a lot of bugs in its layout engine (tables, for example).
It is still (after 25 years !) a preliminary implementation of a help viewer.
<P>
Summary: you can use another viewer for a slightly better look,
but you will not get the interactive experience.





<H2><A NAME="NAVIGATING" HREF="#I_NAVIGATING">Navigating</A></H2>

In the text, you will find
<A HREF="YES.html">highlighted</A>
items which contain
references to other parts of the documentation.
<P>
A single click on such an item will locate and show the
corresponding part of the documentation.
<P>
The help viewer keeps a history of vistited documents;
the "<KBD>back</KBD>" button returns to the
previous document(s).
The "<KBD>home</KBD>" button returns you to the
top introduction document.
<P>
Most documents contain extra navigation buttons located at the
beginning of the document.
The "<KBD>prev</KBD>" (left arrow)
and
"<KBD>next</KBD>" (right arrow) buttons
lead you to the previous/next chapter in the same
hierarchy level of the documentation.
The "<KBD>up</KBD>" (up arrow) button leads you back
to the next higher level.



<H2><A NAME="NOTATION" HREF="#I_NOTATION">Notational Conventions</A></H2>

The documentation uses different font styles to distinguish plain text
from variables, code fragments, examples etc.
The  layout may vary with  different HTML viewers and their
configuration settings. The documents may also look slightly
different in printed form.
<P>

Cross references within this documentation usually include the
title of the referenced section or chapter enclosed in
quotation marks
(e.g., see <A HREF="../whatsNew.html">"What's new in the documentation"</A>).
<P>

Lowercase italic type represents a <VAR>variable</VAR>,
a placeholder for the text you actually enter.
A variable can consist of different characters each time you make the entry.
A typical example would be: "<VAR>someArray</VAR> <CODE>at:</CODE><VAR>index</VAR>".
<P>
Italic type is also used when some term is defined in the text, as in:
<BR>
"<VAR>an executable example</VAR>" is a code fragment that is executed
when clicked upon.
<P>

Smalltalk code, constants, class names etc. are
identified by a courier font, such as
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the <CODE>UndefinedObject</CODE> class ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
or
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the <CODE>#at:put:</CODE> selector ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is also true for code fragments or example expressions such as:
<CODE><PRE>
	Transcript showCR:'hello world'
</PRE></CODE>
<P>

To distinguish symbols and message selectors from regular strings or variable names,
these are typically prefixed by a "#" character, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the <CODE>#new</CODE>-message creates a new instance ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
or a "#" character followed by a quoted string, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the <CODE>#'foo_bar'</CODE>-message does this and that ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Filenames are also shown in a monospaced font, but have additional
quotes around them, as in <CODE>"/usr/lib/smalltalk/smalltalk.rc"</CODE>.
<P>


Keys that are labeled on your keyboard with more than one character,
such as the "<KBD>RETURN</KBD>" key,
are identified by all uppercase letters in a bold courier font.
Keys that you are to press simultaneously or in succession
are linked with a hyphen (e.g., press "<KBD>SHIFT-ALT-d</KBD>").
<BR>
If multiple keys are to be pressed in sequence, no hyphen is shown
(e.g., as in "<KBD>COMPOSE a *</KBD>").
<P>

<!--

<H2><A NAME="COPY_PASTE" HREF="#I_COPY_PASTE">Copy & Paste</A></H2>

You can copy text from the help viewer and paste
it into some other view. For example, you may want to
take some example code and try a modified version in a workspace.
<P>
Due to the implementation
(the help viewer uses an Xt-widget for its underlying view),
selecting text in the example viewer automatically copies
it into the copyBuffer (i.e. there is no extra <VAR>copy</VAR>
operation required.
<P>
Thus, to copy some text into a workspace, simply select it in
the help viewer and immediately paste it into the workspace.

-->


<H2><A NAME="EXAMPLES" HREF="#I_EXAMPLES">Executable Examples</A></H2>

In some sections you will find executable example code or code fragments.
You can execute those iretly from within the help viewer
by clicking on them.
<P>
Like other code fragments, executable examples are layed out in a fixed (Courier) font
but rendered in a different (darkened red) color.
<A TYPE="example">
<CODE><PRE>
    Transcript topView raise.
    Transcript showCR:'hello world'
</PRE></CODE>
</A>
If you have problems with red/green colors, please change the color settings in the help viewer's
settings dialog.
<P>
The help viewer will catch errors occurring in those examples and
show a warn box.
Examples which produce such an
error by purpose (to demonstrate error behavior),
can also be copied into a workspace and executed there (right-click on the example's text
to get a popUp-menu).
<BR>
Try:
<A TYPE="example">
<CODE><PRE>
    5 / (3 - 3)
</PRE></CODE>
</A>
which will bring you into the debugger due to a division by zero error.
<P>

Programmed halts and breakpoints will also bring you directly into the debugger.
<BR>
Try also:
<A TYPE="example">
<CODE><PRE>
    self halt
</PRE></CODE>
</A>

Executable examples are a special feature of the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> help viewer.
In regular browsers, such as Firefox, IE, Safari or any other
HTML reader or web browser, these cannot be executed and an error page will be shown.
<P>

An example's text can also be copied to a workspace as follows:
<UL>
<LI> place the mouse-pointer over the example
<BR>
<LI> press the right (or middle-) button for a popup menu
<BR>
<LI> select the "<VAR>Copy Example's text</VAR>" item
<BR>
<LI> <VAR>paste</VAR> the text in a workspace window
</UL>
<P>
alternatively, the "<VAR>Open Workspace on Example's Text</VAR>" menu item will
open a new workspace which contains the example.
<P>
In the workspace, you may want to try variations of the example
(trying different parameters, for example).
<P>
<P>

<STRONG>SECURITY WARNING:</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be careful with documents provided by untrusted people:
<P>
Since the examples are executed by your running Smalltalk system,
a bad guy can place example code into a document,
which could be harmful to your (Smalltalk-) system.
<BR>
Always read and understand what is going on the code example,
before executing it.
<BR>
In the help viewer, you can disable example execution,
to avoid executing any code by unintended clicks.
<P>
In non-Smalltalk HTML readers, command execution is not possible
and there is no danger whatsoever with examples.
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H2><A NAME="DYNAMICLINKS" HREF="#I_DYNAMICLINKS">Dynamic links (executed hrefs)</A></H2>

A link may be defined to execute some Smalltalk action;
from a technical point of view, they are much like executable examples,
but the text which is shown is different from the executed code.
<P>
For example:
<BR>
Click
<A HREF="onlyInSTX.html" ACTION="doit:UserPreferences browserClass open" INFO="open a browser">
here</A> to open a browser.
<BR>
Or click
<A HREF="onlyInSTX.html"
   INFO="ask for class and open a browser"
   ACTION="doit:
    |cls|
    cls := Dialog request:'Class:'.
    cls notNil ifTrue:[
	cls := Smalltalk at:cls asSymbol ifAbsent:nil.
	cls notNil ifTrue:[
	   Smalltalk browseInClass:cls selector:nil
	]
    ]
">
here</A> to ask for a class and open a browser there.
<BR>
Click
<A HREF="onlyInSTX.html"
   INFO="browse ApplicationModel"
   ACTION="browse:ApplicationModel"
>here</A>, to browse the ApplicationModel class.
<P>
The above security warning also applies to this type of code execution.


<H2><A NAME="INTERACT" HREF="#I_INTERACT">Interactive Documents</A></H2>

In some sections, you may find interactive elements, such as
buttons or input fields.
These fields can be filled out and actions are performed when
the button is pressed.
<BR>
For example:

<FORM ACTION="onlyInSTX.html"
      METHOD="DOIT | :entry |
	|cls|

	entry isEmpty ifTrue:[
	    self warn:'enter a class name first'
	] ifFalse:[
	    cls := Smalltalk classNamed:entry withoutSeparators.
	    Smalltalk browseInClass:cls
	]
      ">

Enter the name of a class here: <INPUT SIZE=45 NAME="entry" VALUE="SequenceableCollection">
<BR>
To browse, press:
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="browse">.
</FORM>
<P>

or:

<FORM ACTION="onlyInSTX.html"
      METHOD="DOIT | :className :selector |
	|cls sel|

	className isEmpty ifTrue:[
	    self warn:'enter a class name first'
	] ifFalse:[
	    selector isEmpty ifTrue:[
		self warn:'enter a selector first'
	    ] ifFalse:[
		cls := Smalltalk classNamed:className withoutSeparators.
		sel := selector withoutSeparators asSymbol.
		Smalltalk browseInClass:cls selector:sel
	    ]
	]
      ">

Enter the name of a class:
<INPUT SIZE=45 NAME="className" VALUE="SequenceableCollection">
<BR>
and selector: <INPUT SIZE=45 NAME="selector" VALUE="sort">
<BR>
press:
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="browse">.
</FORM>

<P>


For these fillout forms, the same security dangers
are to be considered as for executable examples
(even more, since you do not see the underlying code).
Therefore, these can also be disabled in the help viewer
when reading untrusted documents. If disabled, the
help viewer will show the underlying code in a box instead.

The <CITE>ST/X</CITE> documents as provided here
were of course written with great care to avoid doing any
harm to your Smalltalk environment - however, even these
documents could have been modified by someone else at the time
you read them...
