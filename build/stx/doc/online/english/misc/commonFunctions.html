<UL>

<LI><A NAME="CUT">Cut</A>
<BR>
<VAR>Cut</VAR> removes the selected text and places a copy into
the <VAR>cut&amp;paste buffer</VAR> (<VAR>clipBoard</VAR>).
<P>


<LI><A NAME="PASTE">Paste</A>
<BR>
<VAR>Paste</VAR> inserts the contents of the <VAR>cut&amp;paste buffer</VAR> (<VAR>clipBoard</VAR>)
and inserts it at the current cursor position.
If there was a selection, the selection will be <VAR>replaced</VAR> by
the contents of the <VAR>cut&amp;paste buffer</VAR>.
<P>


<LI><A NAME="REPLACE">Replace</A>
<BR>
see <VAR>Paste</VAR>
<P>


<LI><A NAME="UNDO">Undo</A>
<BR>
Undo the last editing operation.
<P>


<LI><A NAME="AGAIN">Again</A>
<BR>
<VAR>Again</VAR> repeats the last <VAR>Cut</VAR> or <VAR>Replace</VAR> operation after
searching forward in the text for
the next occurence of the relevant character sequence.
<BR>
For example, to change all occurences of <KBD>"foo"</KBD> by <KBD>"bar"</KBD> in your text,
go to the first <KBD>"foo"</KBD>, select it, type <KBD>"bar"</KBD> and repeat this operation
by pressing <VAR>again</VAR> until no more occurences are found in the text.
<P>




<LI><A NAME="ACCEPT">Accept</A>
<BR>
<VAR>Accepting</VAR> means "<VAR>take that text and make it permanent</VAR>".
<P>
In Smalltalk, most editing is modeless - this means, that your changes do not
affect the underlying text or object until you say so by "<VAR>accepting</VAR>".
<P>
The exact meaning of "<VAR>accept</VAR>" depends on the context in which this command is executed:
<UL>
<LI>
A fileBrowser will save the text in the edited file.
<LI>
A systemBrowser, will compile and install the code or class being edited.
<LI>
Other editors would save their model.
</UL>
