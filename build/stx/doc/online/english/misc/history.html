<H1>History of Smalltalk/X (ST/X, pronounced 'STIX')</H1>

    This little text is meant as a kind of FAQ on <CITE>ST/X</CITE>;
    these questions have been asked so often, that I finally
    wrote the answers down ...


<H2>First implementation</H2>

    The main trigger for creating a Smalltalk was (of course)
    the famous Byte edition (Aug. 81),
    which focused especially on the Smalltalk language.
<BR>
    I (Claus) was immediately fascinated by the language and its underlying
    philosophy - certainly, I wanted such a system.
<br>
    Since I had no chance of getting my hands on any existing system
    (at that time), I started to play around implementing fragments of
    what I saw in Basic (yes, that's true),
    and dreamed about a full implementation.
<P>
    Some time later, I got hold of the (excellent) book
<A HREF="../overview/literature.html#[1]"><CITE>"Smalltalk-80, the language and implementation"</CITE></A>,
    after that
    I started to implement an experimental bytecode interpreter.
<P>
    The bad performance of this interpreter lead soon to the
    conclusion, that only compilation to machine language will
    provide acceptable performance.
<P>
    Due to previous (positive) experience with other cross-language
    compilers (Basic-to-C :-)) and Lisp-to-C) this approach was
    also taken, eventually leading to the first running Smalltalk-to-C
    (<VAR>stc</VAR>) compiler during 1986/1987.
    (the experiments began a few years earlier, but the full Smalltalk
     semantics - especially contexts & blocks - was finally implemented
     at that time).
<BR>
     Notice, that this was before dynamic translation of bytecode
     to machine code (aka JIT-ting) was well known, and I had no running
     Smalltalk at hand to start with.
     So the system was written completely from scratch in a "clean-room"
     environment. I decided to use yacc+lex to parse Smalltalk code (in fileOut format),
     and generate C-code from it.
<P>
     This source-to-source compiler was named "stc"
     (for "Smalltalk-to-C") and this compiler is still used today
     (although it went through many revisions, as new syntax, features and optimizations where added).

<H2>The "X" in "Smalltalk/X"</H2>

    At about the same time, a first interface to the X Window system
    was created - providing a true mapping of Smalltalk views to
    X's windows. Although not noticed in the outside world, this
    was a world premiere - the other available system at that time
    (on unix systems) was NOT using a direct view-to-window
    relation, but simulated its own windowing system in one big
    X window.
<BR>
    That's where the "X" in <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> originated.
<P>
    Of course, in the meantime, this is also done by other Smalltalk
    systems, and Smalltalk/X nowadays also runs under non-X (e.g. Windows) systems,
    making the "X" a historical leftover
    (which is kept until I may find a better name :-).
<P>
    Notice, that there is another package called <CODE>"STIX"</CODE> around:
    the <CITE>"GNU-Smalltalk's X extension"</CITE>.
    These two have nothing in common
    and <CODE>"ST/X"</CODE> (<CITE>"Smalltalk/X"</CITE>) should not be confused
    with <CODE>"STIX"</CODE>.

<H2>Licensing & Compatibility</H2>

    ParcPlace allows licensing the basic classes (names & inheritance)
    for a symbolic 1$ fee, and thus allows a (re-) implementation to provide a comparable
    class hierarchy and instance protocol.
    <CITE>Smalltalk/X's</CITE>
    basic classes are written to be protocol compatible to the corresponding
    <CITE>Smalltalk-80</CITE> classes,
    and I still have the original licence paper framed on the wall.
<BR>
    The development of those classes was (and still is) done
    without referring to the original implementation
    (so called <VAR>"clean room development"</VAR>).
    The information about class protocol was taken from public available
    literature, information returned by alpha testers and by porting public
    domain code, which uses that protocol.
<P>
    The author still depends on testers to send a note if any incompatibilities
    are encountered. Such a note should include the class & method name and a
    verbal description of what it should do. Also, incompatible instancevariable
    names are worth such a note (since those names should match for proper
    subclassability).
    Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> send any code which is based on or derived
    from any other existing Smalltalk system - I cannot make any use of it.
<P>
    Since this (ParcPlace-) license does not cover the View and GUI elements,
    those classes are not (and may never be) fully compatible to ParcPlace
    implementations - however, some hooks and compatibility methods have been built in,
    in order to make porting at least easier
    (in the recent past, we have spent quite some effort in making ST/X very compatible
     to VisualWorks, making it very easy to port even highly GUI intensive code).
<P>
    This may change if ongoing standardization efforts lead to an
    "Ansi Smalltalk" covering these classes. However, since even basic
    features (such as Blocks being closures) seem to make trouble in
    standardization, I personally doubt that there will be a standard
    covering these classes in the near future.
<P>

<H2>Compilation</H2>

    The original (1986) system did NOT include a bytecode compiler or
    interpreter; it was purely batch oriented (much like traditional
    language systems). I used it to write GUI applications, test and maintenance programs
    in a traditional manner, using editors such as vi or emacs.
<br>
    An early plan was to offer the STC-compiler
    as a turbo charger for existing Smalltalk systems.
<P>
    However, for development & prototyping, it became soon obvious
    that an incremental compiler was needed to be available IN the
    system and a bytecode compiler and interpreter were added during 1988.
    This allowed for a much better development experience, as code can now be
    executed inside the system, without the tedious save-compile-restart cycle.
<P>
    A dynamic machine code compiler (JITter) was added shortly after that,
    around 1990. Initially, it supported MIPS and Sparc CPUs, but over time,
    many more architectures were added, some of which are now obsolete and no
    longer maintained (but could be reactivated relatively easily, if a demand arises).
<P>
    Thus, in <CITE>ST/X</CITE> things were developed vice versa - first came the
    standAlone compiler, then the bytecodes and incremental compilation.


<H2>Development</H2>

    Till 1994, development of <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> was done in
    spare time as a single person's <VAR>"hobby"</VAR> project.
<BR>
    In 1994, ACC Software was founded, which was later renamed and
    incorporated as eXept Software AG.
<br>
    Most further development is now done withing eXept, although the rights
    on the basic Smalltalk/X engine, VM (runtime system) and stc are still at
    Claus, with eXept having an unlimited right of using it.
<BR>
    "eXept Software" was founded by a group of people who wanted to make
    their living not just by programming, but by having FUN doing so.
    As a consequence, we want to use an environment which
    supports us as programmers and which helps us to realize our dreams faster,
    and with less time to be spent on low level (programming language) details.
<br>
    Smalltalk may not be perfect,
    but it is certainly by far the best system to our knowledge.
    And this is still true over 20 years later.
<P>
    Many testers and more people joined the team,
    providing suggestions, hints, bug reports and adding new features.
<P>
    If you like to participate in the development and/or donate code,
    new classes, examples or applications, feel free to contact the author
    or eXept, to have it included in the next distribution.
<P>
    Be aware, that eXept has to earn money to pay its employees (what did you think?).
    While you get ST/X for free, it must be clear that we cannot spend our time
    with developing Smalltalk alone.
    Therefore, what you get is the fall-out of what we need for our own products and
     development.
<P>
    If you have any wishes for improvement, support or a port to a particular
    machine, we have to ask for money.
    Customers for which ST/X is mission critical (yes, there a quite a few!)
    may get a maintenance contract which gives them online support, consulting,
    feature implementation upon request, regular updates and online access to the
    current development versions.
    Please contact info@exept.de for details.
<P>
    Without such a contract, you will have to wait for whenever we find time to
    provide a new free version.
    However, this is usually somewhat older (1/2 to 1 year)
    from what maintenance customers get.

<H2>Future</H2>

    We all do not like Java - in fact, we think it is a poor man's, half way thought through
    implementation of something which is in between C++ and Smalltalk.
    A big improvement for a C or C++ programmer, but certainly a
    step back if viewed from Smalltalk.
<br>
    However, many people do not need (or want) to use the full power of Smalltalk,
    and are perfectly happy with it.
    Therefore, we think that a Smalltalk environment which supports and embraces the
    Java world perfectly makes sense and would be a nice thing to have.
<br>
    Our current goal is to enhance the Smalltalk system to allow for other languages
    to fit easily and seamless into the real (Smalltalk) world
    - after all, all of todays other so-called OO-languages are (semantically)
    true subsets of Smalltalk.
<P>
    The current system includes a Java support subsystem, which is able to
    read binary Java class files, and load them almost seamless into the Smalltalk
    class hierarchy (under a separate JAVA namespace).
    The VM and Jitter do handle Java-bytecode methods transparently,
    so Smalltalk can call Java and vice versa.
    In fact, Java objects are represented as Smalltalk objects internally,
    so there is no gap in the object representation.
    All reflective features of Smalltalk are also available with Java classes/methods and
    objects. And all dynamic features are available for Java code - this includes
    dynamic change of object layouts, adding/removing methods, changing the
    inheritance and accepting in the debugger.
<P>
    Ongoing work is done in the browser, code completion and refactoring tools.
    Thanks to Marcel, Jan and the other guys from the Prag-CVUT Computer Science
    lab for lots of stuff in this area.
