<H1>Dreams - things we would like to find time (and financing) to work on</H1>

There are a bunch of ideas which are waiting to be implemented:
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Redesigning the VM
<br>using a more flexible (and language independent) object layout, to
allow for easier integration of alien languages, to support the idea
of a global (world-wide) Smalltalk image (without a need for ugly corba,
to talk to other objects).
<P>
<LI>Redesigning the VM,
<br>trying new memory management algorithms (train)
<P>
<LI>exposing the semantics of bytecodes
<br>
All of the bytecode compilation, interpretation and jitting should be
done on the Smalltalk class level; in fact, all of the above should be
user-modifyable code in Method (or subclasses).
<br>
This would enable everybody to tune the virtual machine to personal needs,
and to use Smalltalk to explore new languages (at full speed).
<br>
Late note: we started the OpenVM project at CS6 - this will get rid of bytecodes alltogether.
(bytecodes are not very object oriented and should be removed - much more reflection is
possible if we go the lisp way...)
</UL>

<H1>Ongoing work - things we are working on</H1>

<UL>

<LI>Finishing the Smalltalk/Java integration
<BR>
The second part will allow recompilation (i.e. 'accepting') java
methods within the Smalltalk browser.
<P>


<LI>Add dynamic customization to the JIT compiler
<BR>
This will boost the performance of JIT compiled code.
<BR>
However, a trade has to be made between recompilation speed
and execution speed - to avoid spending a lot of time in
the JIT compiler for methods which are seldom invoked.
<P>


<LI>image interchange between different platforms

<P>
<LI>different GC algorithms for special needs (plug-in GC modules, realtime support)

<P>
<LI>multiple oldSpaces

<P>
<LI>shared object spaces, attach/detach to shared spaces

<P>
<LI>support for continuations

</UL>
