This chapter is for people who have never used
CVS, and perhaps have never used version control
software before.

</P>
<P>
If you are already familiar with CVS and are just
trying to learn a particular feature or remember a
certain command, you can probably skip everything here.

CVS is a version control system.  Using it, you can
record the history of your source files.

</P>

<P>
For example, bugs sometimes creep in when
software is modified, and you might not detect the bug
until a long time after you make the modification.
With CVS, you can easily retrieve old versions to see
exactly which change caused the bug.  This can
sometimes be a big help.

</P>
<P>
You could of course save every version of every file
you have ever created.  This would
however waste an enormous amount of disk space.  CVS
stores all the versions of a file in a single file in a
clever way that only stores the differences between
versions.

</P>
<P>
CVS also helps you if you are part of a group of people working
on the same project.  It is all too easy to overwrite
each others' changes unless you are extremely careful.
Some editors, like GNU Emacs, try to make sure that
the same file is never modified by two people at the
same time.  Unfortunately, if someone is using another
editor, that safeguard will not work.  CVS solves this problem
by insulating the different developers from each other.  Every
developer works in his own directory, and CVS merges
the work when each developer is done.

CVS started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by
Dick Grune, posted to the newsgroup
<CODE>comp.sources.unix</CODE> in the volume 6
release of December, 1986.  While no actual code from
these shell scripts is present in the current version
of CVS much of the CVS conflict resolution algorithms
come from them.

</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded CVS.
Jeff Polk later helped Brian with the design of the CVS
module and vendor branch support.

If you prefer a usenet group, the right
group is <CODE>comp.software.config-mgmt</CODE> which is for
CVS discussions (along with other configuration
management systems).  In the future, it might be
possible to create a
<CODE>comp.software.config-mgmt.cvs</CODE>, but probably only
if there is sufficient CVS traffic on

CVS can do a lot of things for you, but it does
not try to be everything for everyone.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>CVS is not a build system.
<DD>
Though the structure of your repository and modules
file interact with your build system
(e.g. <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s), they are essentially
independent.

CVS does not dictate how you build anything.  It
merely stores files for retrieval in a tree structure
you devise.

CVS does not dictate how to use disk space in the
checked out working directories.  If you write your
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>s or scripts in every directory so they
have to know the relative positions of everything else,
you wind up requiring the entire repository to be
checked out.

If you modularize your work, and construct a build
system that will share files (via links, mounts,
<CODE>VPATH</CODE> in <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s, etc.), you can
arrange your disk usage however you like.

But you have to remember that <EM>any</EM> such system is
a lot of work to construct and maintain.  CVS does
not address the issues involved.

Of course, you should place the tools created to
support such a build system (scripts, <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s,
etc) under CVS.

Figuring out what files need to be rebuilt when
something changes is, again, something to be handled
outside the scope of CVS.  One traditional
approach is to use <CODE>make</CODE> for building, and use
some automated tool for generating the dependencies which
<CODE>make</CODE> uses.

See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC105">How your build system interacts with CVS</A>, for more information on doing builds
in conjunction with CVS.

<DT>CVS is not a substitute for management.
<DD>
Your managers and project leaders are expected to talk
to you frequently enough to make certain you are aware
of schedules, merge points, branch names and release
dates.  If they don't, CVS can't help.

CVS is an instrument for making sources dance to
your tune.  But you are the piper and the composer.  No
instrument plays itself or writes its own music.

<DT>CVS is not a substitute for developer communication.
<DD>
When faced with conflicts within a single file, most
developers manage to resolve them without too much
effort.  But a more general definition of "conflict"
includes problems too difficult to solve without
communication between developers.

CVS cannot determine when simultaneous changes
within a single file, or across a whole collection of
files, will logically conflict with one another.  Its
concept of a <STRONG>conflict</STRONG> is purely textual, arising
when two changes to the same base file are near enough
to spook the merge (i.e. <CODE>diff3</CODE>) command.

CVS does not claim to help at all in figuring out
non-textual or distributed conflicts in program logic.

For example: Say you change the arguments to function
<CODE>X</CODE> defined in file <TT>`A'</TT>.  At the same time,
someone edits file <TT>`B'</TT>, adding new calls to
function <CODE>X</CODE> using the old arguments.  You are
outside the realm of CVS's competence.

Acquire the habit of reading specs and talking to your
peers.

<DT>CVS does not have change control
<DD>
Change control refers to a number of things.  First of
all it can mean <STRONG>bug-tracking</STRONG>, that is being able
to keep a database of reported bugs and the status of
each one (is it fixed?  in what release?  has the bug
submitter agreed that it is fixed?).  For interfacing
CVS to an external bug-tracking system, see the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> and <TT>`verifymsg'</TT> files
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC152">Reference manual for Administrative files</A>).

Another aspect of change control is keeping track of
the fact that changes to several files were in fact
changed together as one logical change.  If you check
in several files in a single <CODE>cvs commit</CODE>
operation, CVS then forgets that those files were
checked in together, and the fact that they have the
same log message is the only thing tying them
together.  Keeping a GNU style <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT>
can help somewhat.

Another aspect of change control, in some systems, is
the ability to keep track of the status of each
change.  Some changes have been written by a developer,
others have been reviewed by a second developer, and so
on.  Generally, the way to do this with CVS is to
generate a diff (using <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> or <CODE>diff</CODE>)
and email it to someone who can then apply it using the
<CODE>patch</CODE> utility.  This is very flexible, but
depends on mechanisms outside CVS to make sure
nothing falls through the cracks.

<DT>CVS is not an automated testing program
<DD>
It should be possible to enforce mandatory use of a
testsuite using the <CODE>commitinfo</CODE> file.  I haven't
heard a lot about projects trying to do that or whether
there are subtle gotchas, however.

<DT>CVS does not have a builtin process model
<DD>
Some systems provide ways to ensure that changes or
releases go through various steps, with various
approvals as needed.  Generally, one can accomplish
this with CVS but it might be a little more work.
In some cases you'll want to use the <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT>, <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT>, or <TT>`verifymsg'</TT>
files, to require that certain steps be performed
before cvs will allow a checkin.  Also consider whether
features such as branches and tags can be used to
perform tasks such as doing work in a development tree
and then merging certain changes over to a stable tree
only once they have been proven.

<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC4">A sample session</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>

</P>

<P>
As a way of introducing CVS, we'll go through a
typical work-session using CVS.  The first thing
to understand is that CVS stores all files in a
centralized <STRONG>repository</STRONG> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC9">The Repository</A>); this
section assumes that a repository is set up.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you are working on a simple compiler.  The source
consists of a handful of C files and a <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.
The compiler is called <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP> (Trivial Compiler),
and the repository is set up so that there is a module
called <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC5">Getting the source</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>

</P>
<P>
The first thing you must do is to get your own working copy of the
source for <SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>.  For this, you use the <CODE>checkout</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout tc
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a new directory called <TT>`tc'</TT> and populate it with
the source files.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd tc
$ ls
CVS         Makefile    backend.c   driver.c    frontend.c  parser.c
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>`CVS'</TT> directory is used internally by
CVS.  Normally, you should not modify or remove
any of the files in it.

</P>
<P>
You start your favorite editor, hack away at <TT>`backend.c'</TT>, and a couple
of hours later you have added an optimization pass to the compiler.
A note to RCS and SCCS users: There is no need to lock the files that
you want to edit.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC77">Multiple developers</A>, for an explanation.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC6">Committing your changes</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you have checked that the compiler is still compilable you decide
to make a new version of <TT>`backend.c'</TT>.  This will
store your new <TT>`backend.c'</TT> in the repository and
make it available to anyone else who is using that same
repository.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit backend.c
</PRE>

<P>
CVS starts an editor, to allow you to enter a log
message.  You type in "Added an optimization pass.",
save the temporary file, and exit the editor.

</P>
<P>
The environment variable <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> determines
which editor is started.  If <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> is not
set, then if the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> is
set, it will be used. If both <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> and
<CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> are not set then there is a default
which will vary with your operating system, for example
<CODE>vi</CODE> for unix or <CODE>notepad</CODE> for Windows
NT/95.

</P>
<P>
When CVS starts the editor, it includes a list of
files which are modified.  For the CVS client,
this list is based on comparing the modification time
of the file against the modification time that the file
had when it was last gotten or updated.  Therefore, if
a file's modification time has changed but its contents
have not, it will show up as modified.  The simplest
way to handle this is simply not to worry about it--if
you proceed with the commit CVS will detect that
the contents are not modified and treat it as an
unmodified file.  The next <CODE>update</CODE> will clue
CVS in to the fact that the file is unmodified,
and it will reset its stored timestamp so that the file
will not show up in future editor sessions.

</P>
<P>
If you want to avoid
starting an editor you can specify the log message on
the command line using the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> flag instead, like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -m "Added an optimization pass" backend.c
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>

</P>
<P>
Before you turn to other tasks you decide to remove your working copy of
tc.  One acceptable way to do that is of course

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ rm -r tc
</PRE>

<P>
but a better way is to use the <CODE>release</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC140">release--Indicate that a Module is no longer in use</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ cvs release -d tc
M driver.c
? tc
You have [1] altered files in this repository.
Are you sure you want to release (and delete) module `tc': n
** `release' aborted by user choice.
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>release</CODE> command checks that all your modifications have been
committed.  If history logging is enabled it also makes a note in the
history file.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC171">The history file</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you use the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> flag with <CODE>release</CODE>, it
also removes your working copy.

</P>
<P>
In the example above, the <CODE>release</CODE> command wrote a couple of lines
of output.  <SAMP>`? tc'</SAMP> means that the file <TT>`tc'</TT> is unknown to CVS.
That is nothing to worry about: <TT>`tc'</TT> is the executable compiler,
and it should not be stored in the repository.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>,
for information about how to make that warning go away.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC142">release output</A>, for a complete explanation of
all possible output from <CODE>release</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<SAMP>`M driver.c'</SAMP> is more serious.  It means that the
file <TT>`driver.c'</TT> has been modified since it was
checked out.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>release</CODE> command always finishes by telling
you how many modified files you have in your working
copy of the sources, and then asks you for confirmation
before deleting any files or making any note in the
history file.

</P>
<P>
You decide to play it safe and answer <KBD>n <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
when <CODE>release</CODE> asks for confirmation.

</P>

You do not remember modifying <TT>`driver.c'</TT>, so you want to see what

<PRE>
$ cd tc
$ cvs diff driver.c
</PRE>

<P>
This command runs <CODE>diff</CODE> to compare the version of <TT>`driver.c'</TT>

you remember that you added a command line option that enabled the
optimization pass.  You check it in, and release the module.

<P>
The CVS <STRONG>repository</STRONG> stores a complete copy of
all the files and directories which are under version
control.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you never access any of the files in the
repository directly.  Instead, you use CVS
commands to get your own copy of the files into a
<STRONG>working directory</STRONG>, and then
work on that copy.  When you've finished a set of
changes, you check (or <STRONG>commit</STRONG>) them back into the
repository.  The repository then contains the changes
which you have made, as well as recording exactly what
you changed, when you changed it, and other such
information.  Note that the repository is not a
subdirectory of the working directory, or vice versa;
they should be in separate locations.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
CVS can access a repository by a variety of
means.  It might be on the local computer, or it might
be on a computer across the room or across the world.
To distinguish various ways to access a repository, the
repository name can start with an <STRONG>access method</STRONG>.
For example, the access method <CODE>:local:</CODE> means to
access a repository directory, so the repository
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> means that the
repository is in <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> on the
computer running CVS.  For information on other
access methods, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC26">Remote repositories</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the access method is omitted, then if the repository
does not contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, then <CODE>:local:</CODE> is
assumed.  If it does contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> then either
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> or <CODE>:server:</CODE> is assumed.  For
example, if you have a local repository in
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT>, you can use
<CODE>/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> instead of
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE>.  But if (under
Windows NT, for example) your local repository is
<TT>`c:\src\cvsroot'</TT>, then you must specify the access
method, as in <CODE>:local:c:\src\cvsroot</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The repository is split in two parts.  <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> contains
administrative files for CVS.  The other directories contain the actual
user-defined modules.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC10">Telling CVS where your repository is</A></H2>

<P>
There are several ways to tell CVS
where to find the repository.  You can name the
repository on the command line explicitly, with the
<CODE>-d</CODE> (for "directory") option:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d /usr/local/cvsroot checkout yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
Or you can set the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment
variable to an absolute path to the root of the
repository, <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> in this example.
To set <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>, <CODE>csh</CODE> and <CODE>tcsh</CODE>
users should have this line in their <TT>`.cshrc'</TT> or
<TT>`.tcshrc'</TT> files:

</P>

<PRE>
setenv CVSROOT /usr/local/cvsroot
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sh</CODE> and <CODE>bash</CODE> users should instead have these lines in their
<TT>`.profile'</TT> or <TT>`.bashrc'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
CVSROOT=/usr/local/cvsroot
export CVSROOT
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
A repository specified with <CODE>-d</CODE> will
override the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.
Once you've checked a working copy out from the
repository, it will remember where its repository is
(the information is recorded in the
<TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> file in the working copy).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-d</CODE> option and the <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> file both
override the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.  If
<CODE>-d</CODE> option differs from <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT>, the
former is used (and specifying <CODE>-d</CODE> will cause
<TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> to be updated).  Of course, for proper
operation they should be two ways of referring to the
same repository.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC11">How data is stored in the repository</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>

</P>
<P>
For most purposes it isn't important <EM>how</EM>
CVS stores information in the repository.  In
fact, the format has changed in the past, and is likely
to change in the future.  Since in almost all cases one
accesses the repository via CVS commands, such
changes need not be disruptive.

</P>
<P>
However, in some cases it may be necessary to
understand how CVS stores data in the repository,
for example you might need to track down CVS locks
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC82">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>) or you might need to deal with
the file permissions appropriate for the repository.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC12">Where files are stored within the repository</A></H3>

<P>
The overall structure of the repository is a directory
tree corresponding to the directories in the working

The history files contain, among other things, enough
information to recreate any revision of the file, a log
of all commit messages and the user-name of the person
who committed the revision.  The history files are
known as <STRONG>RCS files</STRONG>, because the first program to
store files in that format was a version control system
known as RCS.  For a full
description of the file format, see the <CODE>man</CODE> page
<CITE>rcsfile(5)</CITE>, distributed with RCS, or the
file <TT>`doc/RCSFILES'</TT> in the CVS source
distribution.  This
file format has become very common--many systems other
than CVS or RCS can at least import history
files in this format.

</P>
<P>
The RCS files used in CVS differ in a few
ways from the standard format.  The biggest difference
is magic branches; for more information see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC54">Magic branch numbers</A>.  Also in CVS the valid tag names
are a subset of what RCS accepts; for CVS's
rules see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC47">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>.

All <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> files are created read-only, and you
should not change the permission of those files.  The
directories inside the repository should be writable by
the persons that have permission to modify the files in
each directory.  This normally means that you must
create a UNIX group (see group(5)) consisting of the
persons that are to edit the files in a project, and
set up the repository so that it is that group that
owns the directory.

</P>
<P>
This means that you can only control access to files on
a per-directory basis.

</P>
<P>
Note that users must also have write access to check
out files, because CVS needs to create lock files
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC82">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
Also note that users must have write access to the
<TT>`CVSROOT/val-tags'</TT> file.  CVS uses it to keep
track of what tags are valid tag names (it is sometimes
updated when tags are used, as well as when they are
created).

</P>
<P>
Each RCS file will be owned by the user who last
checked it in.  This has little significance; what
really matters is who owns the directories.

</P>
<P>

CVS tries to set up reasonable file permissions
for new directories that are added inside the tree, but
you must fix the permissions manually when a new
directory should have different permissions than its
parent directory.  If you set the <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE>
environment variable that will control the file
permissions which CVS uses in creating directories
and/or files in the repository.  <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE> does
not affect the file permissions in the working
directory; such files have the permissions which are
typical for newly created files, except that sometimes
CVS creates them read-only (see the sections on
watches, section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC84">Telling CVS to watch certain files</A>; -r, section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>; or CVSREAD, section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
Note that using the client/server CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC26">Remote repositories</A>), there is no good way to
set <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE>; the setting on the client machine
has no effect.  If you are connecting with <CODE>rsh</CODE>, you
can set <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE> in <TT>`.bashrc'</TT> or <TT>`.cshrc'</TT>, as
described in the documentation for your operating
system.  This behavior might change in future versions
of CVS; do not rely on the setting of
<CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE> on the client having no effect.

</P>
<P>
Using pserver, you will generally need stricter
permissions on the CVSROOT directory and
directories above it in the tree; see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A>.

Some operating systems have features which allow a
particular program to run with the ability to perform
operations which the caller of the program could not.
For example, the set user ID (setuid) or set group ID
(setgid) features of unix or the installed image
feature of VMS.  CVS was not written to use such
features and therefore attempting to install CVS in
this fashion will provide protection against only
accidental lapses; anyone who is trying to circumvent
the measure will be able to do so, and depending on how
you have set it up may gain access to more than just
CVS.  You may wish to instead consider pserver.  It
shares some of the same attributes, in terms of
possibly providing a false sense of security or opening
security holes wider than the ones you are trying to
fix, so read the documentation on pserver security
carefully if you are considering this option
(section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A>).

Some of the following might apply to OS/2 but I'm not

</P>
<P>
If you are using local CVS and the repository is on a
networked file system which is served by the Samba SMB
server, some people have reported problems with
permissions.  Enabling WRITE=YES in the samba
configuration is said to fix/workaround it.
Disclaimer: I haven't investigated enough to know the
implications of enabling that option, nor do I know
whether there is something which CVS could be doing
differently in order to avoid the problem.  If you find
something out, please let us know as described in

<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC15">The attic</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>

</P>
<P>
You will notice that sometimes CVS stores an
RCS file in the <CODE>Attic</CODE>.  For example, if the
CVSROOT is <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> and we are
talking about the file <TT>`backend.c'</TT> in the
directory <TT>`yoyodyne/tc'</TT>, then the file normally
would be in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/cvsroot/yoyodyne/tc/backend.c,v
</PRE>

<P>
but if it goes in the attic, it would be in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/cvsroot/yoyodyne/tc/Attic/backend.c,v
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
instead.  It should not matter from a user point of
view whether a file is in the attic; CVS keeps
track of this and looks in the attic when it needs to.
But in case you want to know, the rule is that the RCS
file is stored in the attic if and only if the head
revision on the trunk has state <CODE>dead</CODE>.  A
<CODE>dead</CODE> state means that file has been removed, or
never added, for that revision.  For example, if you
add a file on a branch, it will have a trunk revision
in <CODE>dead</CODE> state, and a branch revision in a
non-<CODE>dead</CODE> state.

The <TT>`CVS'</TT> directory in each repository directory
contains information such as file attributes (in a file

so implementations should silently ignore additional

For an introduction to CVS locks focusing on
user-visible behavior, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC82">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>.  The
following section is aimed at people who are writing
tools which want to access a CVS repository without
interfering with other tools accessing the same
repository.  If you find yourself confused by concepts
described here, like <STRONG>read lock</STRONG>, <STRONG>write lock</STRONG>,
and <STRONG>deadlock</STRONG>, you might consult the literature on
operating systems or databases.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
Any file in the repository with a name starting
with <TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT> is a read lock.  Any file in
the repository with a name starting with
<TT>`#cvs.wfl'</TT> is a write lock.  Old versions of CVS
(before CVS 1.5) also created files with names starting
with <TT>`#cvs.tfl'</TT>, but they are not discussed here.
The directory <TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> serves as a master
lock.  That is, one must obtain this lock first before
creating any of the other locks.

</P>
<P>
To obtain a readlock, first create the <TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT>
directory.  This operation must be atomic (which should
be true for creating a directory under most operating
systems).  If it fails because the directory already
existed, wait for a while and try again.  After
obtaining the <TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> lock, create a file
whose name is <TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT> followed by information
of your choice (for example, hostname and process
identification number).  Then remove the
<TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> directory to release the master lock.
Then proceed with reading the repository.  When you are
done, remove the <TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT> file to release the
read lock.

</P>
<P>
To obtain a writelock, first create the
<TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> directory, as with a readlock.  Then
check that there are no files whose names start with
<TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT>.  If there are, remove
<TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT>, wait for a while, and try again.  If
there are no readers, then create a file whose name is
<TT>`#cvs.wfl'</TT> followed by information of your choice
(for example, hostname and process identification
number).  Hang on to the <TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> lock.  Proceed
with writing the repository.  When you are done, first
remove the <TT>`#cvs.wfl'</TT> file and then the
<TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> directory. Note that unlike the
<TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT> file, the <TT>`#cvs.wfl'</TT> file is just
informational; it has no effect on the locking operation
beyond what is provided by holding on to the
<TT>`#cvs.lock'</TT> lock itself.

</P>
<P>
Note that each lock (writelock or readlock) only locks
a single directory in the repository, including
<TT>`Attic'</TT> and <TT>`CVS'</TT> but not including
subdirectories which represent other directories under
version control.  To lock an entire tree, you need to
lock each directory (note that if you fail to obtain
any lock you need, you must release the whole tree
before waiting and trying again, to avoid deadlocks).

</P>
<P>
Note also that CVS expects writelocks to control
access to individual <TT>`foo,v'</TT> files.  RCS has
a scheme where the <TT>`,foo,'</TT> file serves as a lock,
but CVS does not implement it and so taking out a
CVS writelock is recommended.  See the comments at
rcs_internal_lockfile in the CVS source code for
further discussion/rationale.

<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC18">How files are stored in the CVSROOT directory</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> directory contains the
various administrative files.  In some ways this
directory is just like any other directory in the
repository; it contains RCS files whose names end
in <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP>, and many of the CVS commands operate
on it the same way.  However, there are a few
differences.

</P>
<P>
For each administrative file, in addition to the
RCS file, there is also a checked out copy of the
file.  For example, there is an RCS file
<TT>`loginfo,v'</TT> and a file <TT>`loginfo'</TT> which
contains the latest revision contained in
<TT>`loginfo,v'</TT>.  When you check in an administrative
file, CVS should print

</P>

<PRE>
cvs commit: Rebuilding administrative file database
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
and update the checked out copy in
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT>.  If it does not, there is
something wrong (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>).  To add your own files
to the files to be updated in this fashion, you can add
them to the <TT>`checkoutlist'</TT> administrative file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
By default, the <TT>`modules'</TT> file behaves as
described above.  If the modules file is very large,
storing it as a flat text file may make looking up
modules slow (I'm not sure whether this is as much of a
concern now as when CVS first evolved this
feature; I haven't seen benchmarks).  Therefore, by
making appropriate edits to the CVS source code
one can store the modules file in a database which
implements the <CODE>ndbm</CODE> interface, such as Berkeley
db or GDBM.  If this option is in use, then the modules
database will be stored in the files <TT>`modules.db'</TT>,
<TT>`modules.pag'</TT>, and/or <TT>`modules.dir'</TT>.

</P>

administrative files, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC152">Reference manual for Administrative files</A>.

While we are discussing CVS internals which may
become visible from time to time, we might as well talk
about what CVS puts in the <TT>`CVS'</TT> directories
in the working directories.  As with the repository,
CVS handles this information and one can usually
access it via CVS commands.  But in some cases it
may be useful to look at it, and other programs, such
as the <CODE>jCVS</CODE> graphical user interface or the
<CODE>VC</CODE> package for emacs, may need to look at it.
Such programs should follow the recommendations in this
section if they hope to be able to work with other
programs which use those files, including future
versions of the programs just mentioned and the
command-line CVS client.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`CVS'</TT> directory contains several files.
Programs which are reading this directory should
silently ignore files which are in the directory but
which are not documented here, to allow for future
expansion.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`Root'</TT>
<DD>
This file contains the current CVS root, as
described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC10">Telling CVS where your repository is</A>.

<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<DT><TT>`Repository'</TT>
<DD>
This file contains the directory within the repository
which the current directory corresponds with.  It can
be either an absolute pathname or a relative pathname;
CVS has had the ability to read either format
since at least version 1.3 or so.  The relative
pathname is relative to the root, and is the more
sensible approach, but the absolute pathname is quite
common and implementations should accept either.  For
example, after the command


<PRE>
cvs -d :local:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

<TT>`Root'</TT> will contain


<PRE>
:local:/usr/local/cvsroot
</PRE>

and <TT>`Repository'</TT> will contain either


<PRE>
/usr/local/cvsroot/yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

or


<PRE>
yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<DT><TT>`Entries'</TT>
<DD>
This file lists the files and directories in the
working directory.  It is a text file according to the
conventions appropriate for the operating system in
question.
The first character of each line indicates what sort of
line it is.  If the character is unrecognized, programs
reading the file should silently skip that line, to
allow for future expansion.

If the first character is <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>, then the format is:


<PRE>
/<VAR>name</VAR>/<VAR>revision</VAR>/<VAR>timestamp</VAR>[+<VAR>conflict</VAR>]/<VAR>options</VAR>/<VAR>tagdate</VAR>
</PRE>

where <SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP> are not part of the entry,
but instead indicate that the <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> and conflict
marker are optional.  <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of the
file within the directory.  <VAR>revision</VAR> is the
revision that the file in the working derives from, or
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for an added file, or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> followed by a
revision for a removed file.  <VAR>timestamp</VAR> is the
timestamp of the file at the time that CVS created
it; if the timestamp differs with the actual
modification time of the file it means the file has
been modified.  It is in Universal Time (UT), stored in
the format used by the ISO C asctime() function (for
example, <SAMP>`Sun Apr  7 01:29:26 1996'</SAMP>).  One may
write a string which is not in that format, for
example, <SAMP>`Result of merge'</SAMP>, to indicate that the
file should always be considered to be modified.  This
is not a special case; to see whether a file is
modified a program should take the timestamp of the file
and simply do a string compare with <VAR>timestamp</VAR>.
<VAR>conflict</VAR> indicates that there was
a conflict; if it is the same as the actual
modification time of the file it means that the user
has obviously not resolved the conflict.  <VAR>options</VAR>
contains sticky options (for example <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> for a
binary file).  <VAR>tagdate</VAR> contains <SAMP>`T'</SAMP> followed
by a tag name, or <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> for a date, followed by a
sticky tag or date.  Note that if <VAR>timestamp</VAR>
contains a pair of timestamps separated by a space,
rather than a single timestamp, you are dealing with a
version of CVS earlier than CVS 1.5 (not
documented here).

If the first character of a line in <TT>`Entries'</TT> is
<SAMP>`D'</SAMP>, then it indicates a subdirectory.  <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>
on a line all by itself indicates that the program
which wrote the <TT>`Entries'</TT> file does record
subdirectories (therefore, if there is such a line and
no other lines beginning with <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>, one knows there
are no subdirectories).  Otherwise, the line looks
like:


<PRE>
D/<VAR>name</VAR>/<VAR>filler1</VAR>/<VAR>filler2</VAR>/<VAR>filler3</VAR>/<VAR>filler4</VAR>
</PRE>

where <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of the subdirectory, and
all the <VAR>filler</VAR> fields should be silently ignored,
for future expansion.  Programs which modify
<CODE>Entries</CODE> files should preserve these fields.

<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<DT><TT>`Entries.Log'</TT>
<DD>
This file does not record any information beyond that
in <TT>`Entries'</TT>, but it does provide a way to update
the information without having to rewrite the entire
<TT>`Entries'</TT> file, including the ability to preserve
the information even if the program writing
<TT>`Entries'</TT> and <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT> abruptly aborts.
Programs which are reading the <TT>`Entries'</TT> file
should also check for <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT>.  If the latter
exists, they should read <TT>`Entries'</TT> and then apply
the changes mentioned in <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT>.  After
applying the changes, the recommended practice is to
rewrite <TT>`Entries'</TT> and then delete <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT>.
The format of a line in <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT> is a single
character command followed by a space followed by a
line in the format specified for a line in
<TT>`Entries'</TT>.  The single character command is
<SAMP>`A'</SAMP> to indicate that the entry is being added,
<SAMP>`R'</SAMP> to indicate that the entry is being removed,
or any other character to indicate that the entire line
in <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT> should be silently ignored (for
future expansion).  If the second character of the line
in <TT>`Entries.Log'</TT> is not a space, then it was
written by an older version of CVS (not documented
here).

<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<DT><TT>`Entries.Backup'</TT>
<DD>
This is a temporary file.  Recommended usage is to
write a new entries file to <TT>`Entries.Backup'</TT>, and
then to rename it (atomically, where possible) to <TT>`Entries'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<DT><TT>`Entries.Static'</TT>
<DD>
The only relevant thing about this file is whether it
exists or not.  If it exists, then it means that only
part of a directory was gotten and CVS will
not create additional files in that directory.  To
clear it, use the <CODE>update</CODE> command with the
<SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option, which will get the additional files
and remove <TT>`Entries.Static'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<DT><TT>`Tag'</TT>
<DD>
This file contains per-directory sticky tags or dates.
The first character is <SAMP>`T'</SAMP> for a branch tag,
<SAMP>`N'</SAMP> for a non-branch tag, or <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> for a date,
or another character to mean the file should be
silently ignored, for future expansion.  This character
is followed by the tag or date.  Note that
per-directory sticky tags or dates are used for things
like applying to files which are newly added; they
might not be the same as the sticky tags or dates on
individual files.  For general information on sticky
tags and dates, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>.

<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<DT><TT>`Notify.tmp'</TT>
<DD>
This file is to <TT>`Notify'</TT> as <TT>`Entries.Backup'</TT>
is to <TT>`Entries'</TT>.  That is, to write <TT>`Notify'</TT>,
first write the new contents to <TT>`Notify.tmp'</TT> and
then (atomically where possible), rename it to
<TT>`Notify'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
<DT><TT>`Base'</TT>
<DD>
If watches are in use, then an <CODE>edit</CODE> command
stores the original copy of the file in the <TT>`Base'</TT>
directory.  This allows the <CODE>unedit</CODE> command to
operate even if it is unable to communicate with the
server.

<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<DT><TT>`Baserev'</TT>
<DD>
The file lists the revision for each of the files in
the <TT>`Base'</TT> directory.  The format is:


<PRE>
B<VAR>name</VAR>/<VAR>rev</VAR>/<VAR>expansion</VAR>
</PRE>

where <VAR>expansion</VAR> should be ignored, to allow for
future expansion.

<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
<DT><TT>`Baserev.tmp'</TT>
<DD>
This file is to <TT>`Baserev'</TT> as <TT>`Entries.Backup'</TT>

It is possible to commit an erroneous administrative

In some situations it is a good idea to have more than
one repository, for instance if you have two
development groups that work on separate projects
without sharing any code.  All you have to do to have
several repositories is to specify the appropriate
repository, using the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment
variable, the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option to CVS, or (once
you have checked out a working directory) by simply
allowing CVS to use the repository that was used
to check out the working directory
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC10">Telling CVS where your repository is</A>).

</P>
<P>
The big advantage of having multiple repositories is
that they can reside on different servers.  The big
disadvantage is that you cannot have a single CVS
command recurse into directories which comes from
different repositories.  Generally speaking, if you are
thinking of setting up several repositories on the same
machine, you might want to consider using several
directories within the same repository.

</P>
<P>
None of the examples in this manual show multiple
repositories.

To set up a CVS repository, first choose the
machine and disk on which you want to store the
revision history of the source files.  CPU and memory
requirements are modest, so most machines should be
adequate.  For details see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC27">Server requirements</A>.

</P>
<P>
To estimate disk space
requirements, if you are importing RCS files from
another system, the size of those files is the
approximate initial size of your repository, or if you
are starting without any version history, a rule of
thumb is to allow for the server approximately three
times the size of the code to be under CVS for the
repository (you will eventually outgrow this, but not
for a while).  On the machines on which the developers
will be working, you'll want disk space for
approximately one working directory for each developer
(either the entire tree or a portion of it, depending
on what each developer uses).

</P>
<P>
The repository should be accessible
(directly or via a networked file system) from all
machines which want to use CVS in server or local
mode; the client machines need not have any access to
it other than via the CVS protocol.  It is not
possible to use CVS to read from a repository
which one only has read access to; CVS needs to be
able to create lock files (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC82">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
To create a repository, run the <CODE>cvs init</CODE>
command.  It will set up an empty repository in the
CVS root specified in the usual way
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC9">The Repository</A>).  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d /usr/local/cvsroot init
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> is careful to never overwrite any
existing files in the repository, so no harm is done if
you run <CODE>cvs init</CODE> on an already set-up
repository.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> will enable history logging; if you
don't want that, remove the history file after running
<CODE>cvs init</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC171">The history file</A>.

<A NAME="IDX126"></A>

</P>
<P>
There is nothing particularly magical about the files
in the repository; for the most part it is possible to
back them up just like any other files.  However, there
are a few issues to consider.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
The first is that to be paranoid, one should either not
use CVS during the backup, or have the backup
program lock CVS while doing the backup.  To not
use CVS, you might forbid logins to machines which
can access the repository, turn off your CVS
server, or similar mechanisms.  The details would
depend on your operating system and how you have
CVS set up.  To lock CVS, you would create
<TT>`#cvs.rfl'</TT> locks in each repository directory.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC82">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>, for more on CVS locks.
Having said all this, if you just back up without any
of these precautions, the results are unlikely to be
particularly dire.  Restoring from backup, the
repository might be in an inconsistent state, but this
would not be particularly hard to fix manually.

</P>
<P>
When you restore a repository from backup, assuming
that changes in the repository were made after the time
of the backup, working directories which were not
affected by the failure may refer to revisions which no
longer exist in the repository.  Trying to run CVS
in such directories will typically produce an error
message.  One way to get those changes back into the
repository is as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get a new working directory.

<LI>

Copy the files from the working directory from before
the failure over to the new working directory (do not
copy the contents of the <TT>`CVS'</TT> directories, of
course).

<LI>

Working in the new working directory, use commands such
as <CODE>cvs update</CODE> and <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> to figure out
what has changed, and then when you are ready, commit
the changes into the repository.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
Just as backing up the files in the repository is
pretty much like backing up any other files, if you
need to move a repository from one place to another it
is also pretty much like just moving any other
collection of files.

</P>
<P>
The main thing to consider is that working directories
point to the repository.  The simplest way to deal with
a moved repository is to just get a fresh working
directory after the move.  Of course, you'll want to
make sure that the old working directory had been
checked in before the move, or you figured out some
other way to make sure that you don't lose any
changes.  If you really do want to reuse the existing
working directory, it should be possible with manual
surgery on the <TT>`CVS/Repository'</TT> files.  You can
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC19">How data is stored in the working directory</A>, for information on
the <TT>`CVS/Repository'</TT> and <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT> files, but
unless you are sure you want to bother, it probably
isn't worth it.

Your working copy of the sources can be on a
different machine than the repository.  Using CVS
in this manner is known as <STRONG>client/server</STRONG>
operation.  You run CVS on a machine which can
mount your working directory, known as the
<STRONG>client</STRONG>, and tell it to communicate to a machine
which can mount the repository, known as the
<STRONG>server</STRONG>.  Generally, using a remote
repository is just like using a local one, except that
the format of the repository name is:

</P>

<PRE>
:<VAR>method</VAR>:<VAR>user</VAR>@<VAR>hostname</VAR>:/path/to/repository
</PRE>

<P>
The details of exactly what needs to be set up depend
on how you are connecting to the server.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>method</VAR> is not specified, and the repository
name contains <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, then the default is <CODE>ext</CODE>
or <CODE>server</CODE>, depending on your platform; both are
described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC28">Connecting with rsh</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC27">Server requirements</A></H3>

<P>
The quick answer to what sort of machine is suitable as
a server is that requirements are modest--a server
with 32M of memory or even less can handle a fairly
large source tree with a fair amount of activity.

</P>
<P>
The real answer, of course, is more complicated.
Estimating the known areas of large memory consumption
should be sufficient to estimate memory requirements.
There are two such areas documented here; other memory
consumption should be small by comparison (if you find
that is not the case, let us know, as described in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>, so we can update this documentation).

</P>
<P>
The first area of big memory consumption is large
checkouts, when using the CVS server.  The server
consists of two processes for each client that it is
serving.  Memory consumption on the child process
should remain fairly small.  Memory consumption on the
parent process, particularly if the network connection
to the client is slow, can be expected to grow to
slightly more than the size of the sources in a single
directory, or two megabytes, whichever is larger.

</P>
<P>
Multiplying the size of each CVS server by the
number of servers which you expect to have active at
one time should give an idea of memory requirements for
the server.  For the most part, the memory consumed by
the parent process probably can be swap space rather
than physical memory.

</P>

<P>
The second area of large memory consumption is
<CODE>diff</CODE>, when checking in large files.  This is
required even for binary files.  The rule of thumb is
to allow about ten times the size of the largest file
you will want to check in, although five times may be
adequate.  For example, if you want to check in a file
which is 10 megabytes, you should have 100 megabytes of
memory on the machine doing the checkin (the server
machine for client/server, or the machine running
CVS for non-client/server).  This can be swap
space rather than physical memory.  Because the memory
is only required briefly, there is no particular need
to allow memory for more than one such checkin at a
time.

</P>
<P>
Resource consumption for the client is even more
modest--any machine with enough capacity to run the
operating system in question should have little
trouble.

</P>
<P>
For information on disk space requirements, see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC23">Creating a repository</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC28">Connecting with rsh</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
CVS uses the <TT>`rsh'</TT> protocol to perform these
operations, so the remote user host needs to have a
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> file which grants access to the local
user.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you are the user <TT>`mozart'</TT> on
the local machine <TT>`toe.grunge.com'</TT>, and the
server machine is <TT>`chainsaw.yard.com'</TT>.  On
chainsaw, put the following line into the file
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> in <TT>`bach'</TT>'s home directory:

</P>

<PRE>
toe.grunge.com  mozart
</PRE>

<P>
Then test that <CODE>rsh</CODE> is working with

</P>

<PRE>
rsh -l bach chainsaw.yard.com 'echo $PATH'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
Next you have to make sure that <CODE>rsh</CODE> will be able
to find the server.  Make sure that the path which
<CODE>rsh</CODE> printed in the above example includes the
directory containing a program named <CODE>cvs</CODE> which
is the server.  You need to set the path in
<TT>`.bashrc'</TT>, <TT>`.cshrc'</TT>, etc., not <TT>`.login'</TT>
or <TT>`.profile'</TT>.  Alternately, you can set the
environment variable <CODE>CVS_SERVER</CODE> on the client
machine to the filename of the server you want to use,
for example <TT>`/usr/local/bin/cvs-1.6'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There is no need to edit <CODE>inetd.conf</CODE> or start a
CVS server daemon.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
There are two access methods that you use in CVSROOT
for rsh.  <CODE>:server:</CODE> specifies an internal rsh
client, which is supported only by some CVS ports.
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> specifies an external rsh program.  By
default this is <CODE>rsh</CODE> but you may set the
<CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> environment variable to invoke another
program which can access the remote server (for
example, <CODE>remsh</CODE> on HP-UX 9 because <CODE>rsh</CODE> is
something different).  It must be a program which can
transmit data to and from the server without modifying
it; for example the Windows NT <CODE>rsh</CODE> is not
suitable since it by default translates between CRLF
and LF.  The OS/2 CVS port has a hack to pass <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>
to <CODE>rsh</CODE> to get around this, but since this could
potentially cause problems for programs other than the
standard <CODE>rsh</CODE>, it may change in the future.  If
you set <CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> to <CODE>SSH</CODE> or some other rsh
replacement, the instructions in the rest of this
section concerning <TT>`.rhosts'</TT> and so on are likely
to be inapplicable; consult the documentation for your rsh
replacement.

</P>
<P>
Continuing our example, supposing you want to access
the module <TT>`foo'</TT> in the repository
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot/'</TT>, on machine
<TT>`chainsaw.yard.com'</TT>, you are ready to go:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :ext:bach@chainsaw.yard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo

(The <TT>`bach@'</TT> can be omitted if the username is
the same on both the local and remote hosts.)

<H3><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC29">Direct connection with password authentication</A></H3>

<P>
The CVS client can also connect to the server
using a password protocol.  This is particularly useful
if using <CODE>rsh</CODE> is not feasible (for example,
the server is behind a firewall), and Kerberos also is
not available.

</P>
<P>
To use this method, it is necessary to make
some adjustments on both the server and client sides.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A></H4>

<P>
First of all, you probably want to tighten the
permissions on the <TT>`$CVSROOT'</TT> and
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A>, for more details.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
On the server side, the file <TT>`/etc/inetd.conf'</TT>
needs to be edited so <CODE>inetd</CODE> knows to run the
command <CODE>cvs pserver</CODE> when it receives a
connection on the right port.  By default, the port
number is 2401; it would be different if your client
were compiled with <CODE>CVS_AUTH_PORT</CODE> defined to
something else, though.

</P>
<P>
If your <CODE>inetd</CODE> allows raw port numbers in
<TT>`/etc/inetd.conf'</TT>, then the following (all on a
single line in <TT>`inetd.conf'</TT>) should be sufficient:

</P>

<PRE>
2401  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/bin/cvs
cvs --allow-root=/usr/cvsroot pserver
</PRE>

<P>
You could also use the
<SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option to specify a temporary directory.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`--allow-root'</SAMP> option specifies the allowable
CVSROOT directory.  Clients which attempt to use a
different CVSROOT directory will not be allowed to
connect.  If there is more than one CVSROOT
directory which you want to allow, repeat the option.

</P>
<P>
If your <CODE>inetd</CODE> wants a symbolic service
name instead of a raw port number, then put this in
<TT>`/etc/services'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
cvspserver      2401/tcp
</PRE>

<P>
and put <CODE>cvspserver</CODE> instead of
<CODE>2401</CODE> in <TT>`inetd.conf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Once the above is taken care of, restart your
<CODE>inetd</CODE>, or do whatever is necessary to force it
to reread its initialization files.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
Because the client stores and transmits passwords in
cleartext (almost--see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A>, for details), a separate CVS password
file may be used, so people don't compromise their
regular passwords when they access the repository.
This file is <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd'</TT>
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>).  Its format is
similar to <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT>, except that it only has
two or three fields, username, password, and optional
username for the server to use.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
bach:ULtgRLXo7NRxs
cwang:1sOp854gDF3DY
</PRE>

<P>
The password is encrypted according to the standard
Unix <CODE>crypt()</CODE> function, so it is possible to
paste in passwords directly from regular Unix
<TT>`passwd'</TT> files.

</P>
<P>
When authenticating a password, the server first checks
for the user in the CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file.  If it
finds the user, it compares against that password.  If
it does not find the user, or if the CVS
<TT>`passwd'</TT> file does not exist, then the server
tries to match the password using the system's
user-lookup routine (using the system's user-lookup
routine can be disabled by setting <CODE>SystemAuth=no</CODE>
in the config file, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC173">The CVSROOT/config configuration file</A>).  When using the CVS
<TT>`passwd'</TT> file, the server runs as the
username specified in the third argument in the
entry, or as the first argument if there is no third
argument (in this way CVS allows imaginary
usernames provided the CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file
indicates corresponding valid system usernames).  In
any case, CVS will have no privileges which the
(valid) user would not have.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
It is possible to "map" cvs-specific
usernames onto system usernames (i.e., onto system
login names) in the <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd'</TT> file
by appending a colon and the system username after the
password.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs:ULtgRLXo7NRxs:kfogel
generic:1sOp854gDF3DY:spwang
anyone:1sOp854gDF3DY:spwang
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, someone remotely accessing the repository
on <TT>`chainsaw.yard.com'</TT> with the following
command:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@chainsaw.yard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</PRE>

<P>
would end up running the server under the
system identity kfogel, assuming successful
authentication.  However, the remote user would not
necessarily need to know kfogel's system password, as
the <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd'</TT> file might contain a
different password, used only for CVS.  And as the
example above indicates, it is permissible to map
multiple cvs usernames onto a single system username.

</P>
<P>
This feature is designed to allow people
repository access without full system access (in
particular, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC35">Read-only repository access</A>); however, also
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A>.  Any sort of
repository access very likely implies a degree of
general system access as well.

</P>
<P>
Right now, the only way to put a password in the
CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file is to paste it there from
somewhere else.  Someday, there may be a <CODE>cvs
passwd</CODE> command.

Before connecting to the server, the client must <STRONG>log
in</STRONG> with the command <CODE>cvs login</CODE>.  Logging in
verifies a password with the server, and also records
the password for later transactions with the server.
The <CODE>cvs login</CODE> command needs to know the
username, server hostname, and full repository path,
and it gets this information from the repository
argument or the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>cvs login</CODE> is interactive -- it prompts for a
password:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:bach@chainsaw.yard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot login
CVS password:
</PRE>

<P>
The password is checked with the server; if it is
correct, the <CODE>login</CODE> succeeds, else it fails,
complaining that the password was incorrect.

</P>
<P>
Once you have logged in, you can force CVS to
connect directly to the server and authenticate with
the stored password:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:bach@chainsaw.yard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`:pserver:'</SAMP> is necessary because without it,
CVS will assume it should use <CODE>rsh</CODE> to
connect with the server (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC28">Connecting with rsh</A>).
(Once you have a working copy checked out and are
running CVS commands from within it, there is no
longer any need to specify the repository explicitly,
because CVS records it in the working copy's
<TT>`CVS'</TT> subdirectory.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
Passwords are stored by default in the file
<TT>`$HOME/.cvspass'</TT>.  Its format is human-readable,
but don't edit it unless you know what you are doing.
The passwords are not stored in cleartext, but are
trivially encoded to protect them from "innocent"
compromise (i.e., inadvertently being seen by a system
administrator who happens to look at that file).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
The password for the currently choosen remote repository
can be removed from the CVS_PASSFILE by using the
<CODE>cvs logout</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>CVS_PASSFILE</CODE> environment variable overrides
this default.  If you use this variable, make sure you
set it <EM>before</EM> <CODE>cvs login</CODE> is run.  If you
were to set it after running <CODE>cvs login</CODE>, then
later CVS commands would be unable to look up the
password for transmission to the server.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC32">Security considerations with password authentication</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
The passwords are stored on the client side in a
trivial encoding of the cleartext, and transmitted in
the same encoding.  The encoding is done only to
prevent inadvertent password compromises (i.e., a
system administrator accidentally looking at the file),
and will not prevent even a naive attacker from gaining
the password.

</P>
<P>
The separate CVS password file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>) allows people
to use a different password for repository access than
for login access.  On the other hand, once a user has
non-read-only
access to the repository, she can execute programs on
the server system through a variety of means.  Thus, repository
access implies fairly broad system access as well.  It
might be possible to modify CVS to prevent that,
but no one has done so as of this writing.
Furthermore, there may be other ways in which having
access to CVS allows people to gain more general
access to the system; no one has done a careful audit.

</P>
<P>
Note that because the <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> directory
contains <TT>`passwd'</TT> and other files which are used
to check security, you must control the permissions on
this directory as tightly as the permissions on
<TT>`/etc'</TT>.  The same applies to the <TT>`$CVSROOT'</TT>
directory itself and any directory
above it in the tree.  Anyone who has write access to
such a directory will have the ability to become any
user on the system.  Note that these permissions are
typically tighter than you would use if you are not
using pserver.

</P>
<P>
In summary, anyone who gets the password gets
repository access, and some measure of general system
access as well.  The password is available to anyone
who can sniff network packets or read a protected
(i.e., user read-only) file.  If you want real
security, get Kerberos.

GSSAPI is a generic interface to network security
systems such as Kerberos 5.
If you have a working GSSAPI library, you can have
CVS connect via a direct TCP connection,
authenticating with GSSAPI.

</P>
<P>
To do this, CVS needs to be compiled with GSSAPI
support; when configuring CVS it tries to detect
whether GSSAPI libraries using kerberos version 5 are
present.  You can also use the <TT>`--with-gssapi'</TT>
flag to configure.

</P>
<P>
The connection is authenticated using GSSAPI, but the
message stream is <EM>not</EM> authenticated by default.
You must use the <CODE>-a</CODE> global option to request
stream authentication.

</P>
<P>
The data transmitted is <EM>not</EM> encrypted by
default.  Encryption support must be compiled into both
the client and the server; use the
<TT>`--enable-encrypt'</TT> configure option to turn it on.
You must then use the <CODE>-x</CODE> global option to
request encryption.

</P>
<P>
GSSAPI connections are handled on the server side by
the same server which handles the password
authentication server; see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>.  If you are using a GSSAPI mechanism such as
Kerberos which provides for strong authentication, you
will probably want to disable the ability to
authenticate via cleartext passwords.  To do so, create
an empty <TT>`CVSROOT/passwd'</TT> password file, and set
<CODE>SystemAuth=no</CODE> in the config file
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC173">The CVSROOT/config configuration file</A>).

</P>

The GSSAPI server uses a principal name of
cvs/<VAR>hostname</VAR>, where <VAR>hostname</VAR> is the
canonical name of the server host.  You will have to
set this up as required by your GSSAPI mechanism.

<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC34">Direct connection with kerberos</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
The easiest way to use kerberos is to use the kerberos
<CODE>rsh</CODE>, as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC28">Connecting with rsh</A>.
The main disadvantage of using rsh is that all the data
needs to pass through additional programs, so it may be
slower.  So if you have kerberos installed you can
connect via a direct TCP connection,
authenticating with kerberos.

</P>
<P>
This section concerns the kerberos network security
system, version 4.  Kerberos version 5 is supported via
the GSSAPI generic network security interface, as
described in the previous section.

</P>
<P>
To do this, CVS needs to be compiled with kerberos
support; when configuring CVS it tries to detect
whether kerberos is present or you can use the
<TT>`--with-krb4'</TT> flag to configure.

</P>
<P>
The data transmitted is <EM>not</EM> encrypted by
default.  Encryption support must be compiled into both
the client and server; use the
<TT>`--enable-encryption'</TT> configure option to turn it
on.  You must then use the <CODE>-x</CODE> global option to
request encryption.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
You need to edit <CODE>inetd.conf</CODE> on the server
machine to run <CODE>cvs kserver</CODE>.  The client uses
port 1999 by default; if you want to use another port
specify it in the <CODE>CVS_CLIENT_PORT</CODE> environment
variable on the client.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
When you want to use CVS, get a ticket in the
usual way (generally <CODE>kinit</CODE>); it must be a ticket
which allows you to log into the server machine.  Then
you are ready to go:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :kserver:chainsaw.yard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo

<P>
Previous versions of CVS would fall back to a

<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC35">Read-only repository access</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>

</P>
<P>
It is possible to grant read-only repository
access to people using the password-authenticated
server (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC29">Direct connection with password authentication</A>).  (The
other access methods do not have explicit support for
read-only users because those methods all assume login
access to the repository machine anyway, and therefore
the user can do whatever local file permissions allow
her to do.)

</P>
<P>
A user who has read-only access can do only
those CVS operations which do not modify the
repository, except for certain "administrative" files
(such as lock files and the history file).  It may be
desirable to use this feature in conjunction with
user-aliasing (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>).

</P>
<P>
Unlike with previous versions of CVS, read-only
users should be able merely to read the repository, and
not to execute programs on the server or otherwise gain
unexpected levels of access.  Or to be more accurate,
the <EM>known</EM> holes have been plugged.  Because this
feature is new and has not received a comprehensive
security audit, you should use whatever level of
caution seems warranted given your attitude concerning
security.

</P>
<P>
There are two ways to specify read-only access
for a user: by inclusion, and by exclusion.

</P>
<P>
"Inclusion" means listing that user
specifically in the <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/readers'</TT>
file, which is simply a newline-separated list of
users.  Here is a sample <TT>`readers'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
melissa
splotnik
jrandom
</PRE>

<P>
(Don't forget the newline after the last user.)

</P>
<P>
"Exclusion" means explicitly listing everyone
who has <EM>write</EM> access--if the file

</P>

<PRE>
$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/writers
</PRE>

<P>
exists, then only
those users listed in it have write access, and
everyone else has read-only access (of course, even the
read-only users still need to be listed in the
CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT> file).  The
<TT>`writers'</TT> file has the same format as the
<TT>`readers'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
Note: if your CVS <TT>`passwd'</TT>
file maps cvs users onto system users (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>), make sure you deny or grant
read-only access using the <EM>cvs</EM> usernames, not
the system usernames.  That is, the <TT>`readers'</TT> and
<TT>`writers'</TT> files contain cvs usernames, which may
or may not be the same as system usernames.

</P>
<P>
Here is a complete description of the server's
behavior in deciding whether to grant read-only or
read-write access:

</P>
<P>
If <TT>`readers'</TT> exists, and this user is
listed in it, then she gets read-only access.  Or if
<TT>`writers'</TT> exists, and this user is NOT listed in
it, then she also gets read-only access (this is true
even if <TT>`readers'</TT> exists but she is not listed
there).  Otherwise, she gets full read-write access.

</P>
<P>
Of course there is a conflict if the user is
listed in both files.  This is resolved in the more
conservative way, it being better to protect the
repository too much than too little: such a user gets
read-only access.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC36">Temporary directories for the server</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>

</P>
<P>
While running, the CVS server creates temporary
directories.  They are named

</P>

<PRE>
cvs-serv<VAR>pid</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>pid</VAR> is the process identification number of
the server.  They are located in the directory
specified by the <SAMP>`TMPDIR'</SAMP> environment variable
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>), the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> global
option (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>), or failing that
<TT>`/tmp'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
In most cases the server will remove the temporary
directory when it is done, whether it finishes normally
or abnormally.  However, there are a few cases in which
the server does not or cannot remove the temporary
directory, for example:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If the server aborts due to an internal server error,
it may preserve the directory to aid in debugging

<LI>

If the server is killed in a way that it has no way of
cleaning up (most notably, <SAMP>`kill -KILL'</SAMP> on unix).

<LI>

If the system shuts down without an orderly shutdown,
which tells the server to clean up.
</UL>

<P>
In cases such as this, you will need to manually remove
the <TT>`cvs-serv<VAR>pid</VAR>'</TT> directories.  As long as
there is no server running with process identification
number <VAR>pid</VAR>, it is safe to do so.

Because renaming files and moving them between
directories is somewhat inconvenient, the first thing
you do when you start a new project should be to think
through your file organization.  It is not impossible
to rename or move files, but it does increase the
potential for confusion and CVS does have some
quirks particularly in the area of renaming
directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC64">Moving and renaming files</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you begin using CVS, you will probably already have several
projects that can be
put under CVS control.  In these cases the easiest way is to use the
<CODE>import</CODE> command.  An example is probably the easiest way to
explain how to use it.  If the files you want to install in
CVS reside in <TT>`<VAR>wdir</VAR>'</TT>, and you want them to appear in the
repository as <TT>`$CVSROOT/yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR>'</TT>, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd <VAR>wdir</VAR>
$ cvs import -m "Imported sources" yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR> yoyo start
</PRE>

<P>
Unless you supply a log message with the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>
flag, CVS starts an editor and prompts for a
message.  The string <SAMP>`yoyo'</SAMP> is a <STRONG>vendor tag</STRONG>,
and <SAMP>`start'</SAMP> is a <STRONG>release tag</STRONG>.  They may fill
no purpose in this context, but since CVS requires
them they must be present.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC98">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
more information about them.

</P>
<P>
You can now verify that it worked, and remove your
original source directory.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ mv <VAR>dir</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
$ cvs checkout yoyodyne/<VAR>dir</VAR>       # Explanation below
$ diff -r <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig yoyodyne/<VAR>dir</VAR>
$ rm -r <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
</PRE>

<P>
Erasing the original sources is a good idea, to make sure that you do
not accidentally edit them in <VAR>dir</VAR>, bypassing CVS.
Of course, it would be wise to make sure that you have
a backup of the sources before you remove them.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>checkout</CODE> command can either take a module
name as argument (as it has done in all previous
examples) or a path name relative to <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>,
as it did in the example above.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to check that the permissions
CVS sets on the directories inside <SAMP>`$CVSROOT'</SAMP>
are reasonable, and that they belong to the proper
groups.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC13">File permissions</A>.

</P>
<P>
If some of the files you want to import are binary, you
may want to use the wrappers features to specify which
files are binary and which are not.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC159">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<A NAME="IDX169"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you have a project which you are maintaining with
another version control system, such as RCS, you
may wish to put the files from that project into
CVS, and preserve the revision history of the
files.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>From RCS
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>

If you have been using RCS, find the RCS
files--usually a file named <TT>`foo.c'</TT> will have its
RCS file in <TT>`RCS/foo.c,v'</TT> (but it could be
other places; consult the RCS documentation for
details).  Then create the appropriate directories in
CVS if they do not already exist.  Then copy the
files into the appropriate directories in the CVS
repository (the name in the repository must be the name
of the source file with <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> added; the files go
directly in the appopriate directory of the repository,
not in an <TT>`RCS'</TT> subdirectory).  This is one of the
few times when it is a good idea to access the CVS
repository directly, rather than using CVS
commands.  Then you are ready to check out a new
working directory.

The RCS file should not be locked when you move it
into CVS; if it is, CVS will have trouble
letting you operate on it.

<DT>From another version control system
<DD>
Many version control systems have the ability to export
RCS files in the standard format.  If yours does,
export the RCS files and then follow the above
instructions.

Failing that, probably your best bet is to write a
script that will check out the files one revision at a
time using the command line interface to the other
system, and then check the revisions into CVS.
The <TT>`sccs2rcs'</TT> script mentioned below may be a
useful example to follow.

<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<DT>From SCCS
<DD>
There is a script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT> directory of
the CVS source distribution called <TT>`sccs2rcs'</TT>
which converts SCCS files to RCS files.
Note: you must run it on a machine which has both
SCCS and RCS installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).

<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
<DT>From PVCS
<DD>
There is a script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT> directory of
the CVS source distribution called <TT>`pvcs_to_rcs'</TT>
which converts PVCS archives to RCS files.
You must run it on a machine which has both
PVCS and RCS installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).  See the comments in the script for details.

<H1><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC43">Revisions</A></H1>

<P>
For many uses of CVS, one doesn't need to worry
too much about revision numbers; CVS assigns
numbers such as <CODE>1.1</CODE>, <CODE>1.2</CODE>, and so on, and
that is all one needs to know.  However, some people
prefer to have more knowledge and control concerning
how CVS assigns revision numbers.

</P>
<P>
If one wants to keep track of a set of revisions
involving more than one file, such as which revisions
went into a particular release, one uses a <STRONG>tag</STRONG>,
which is a symbolic revision which can be assigned to a
numeric revision in each file.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>

</P>
<P>
Each version of a file has a unique <STRONG>revision
number</STRONG>.  Revision numbers look like <SAMP>`1.1'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`1.2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`1.3.2.2'</SAMP> or even <SAMP>`1.3.2.2.4.5'</SAMP>.
A revision number always has an even number of
period-separated decimal integers.  By default revision
1.1 is the first revision of a file.  Each successive
revision is given a new number by increasing the
rightmost number by one.  The following figure displays
a few revisions, with newer revisions to the right.

</P>

<PRE>
       +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+

</PRE>

<P>
It is also possible to end up with numbers containing
more than one period, for example <SAMP>`1.3.2.2'</SAMP>.  Such
revisions represent revisions on branches
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>); such revision numbers
are explained in detail in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC53">Branches and revisions</A>.

A file can have several versions, as described above.
Likewise, a software product can have several versions.
A software product is often given a version number such
as <SAMP>`4.1.1'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Versions in the first sense are called <STRONG>revisions</STRONG>
in this document, and versions in the second sense are
called <STRONG>releases</STRONG>.  To avoid confusion, the word
<STRONG>version</STRONG> is almost never used in this document.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC46">Assigning revisions</A></H2>

<P>
By default, CVS will assign numeric revisions by
leaving the first number the same and incrementing the
second number.  For example, <CODE>1.1</CODE>, <CODE>1.2</CODE>,
<CODE>1.3</CODE>, etc.

</P>
<P>
When adding a new file, the second number will always
be one and the first number will equal the highest
first number of any file in that directory.  For
example, the current directory contains files whose
highest numbered revisions are <CODE>1.7</CODE>, <CODE>3.1</CODE>,
and <CODE>4.12</CODE>, then an added file will be given the
numeric revision <CODE>4.1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Normally there is no reason to care
about the revision numbers--it is easier to treat them
as internal numbers that CVS maintains, and tags
provide a better way to distinguish between things like
release 1 versus release 2 of your product
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC47">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>).  However, if you want to set the
numeric revisions, the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option to <CODE>cvs
commit</CODE> can do that.  The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option implies the
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, in the sense that it causes the
files to be committed even if they are not modified.

</P>
<P>
For example, to bring all your files up to
revision 3.0 (including those that haven't changed),
you might invoke:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -r 3.0
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the number you specify with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> must be
larger than any existing revision number.  That is, if
revision 3.0 exists, you cannot <SAMP>`cvs commit
-r 1.3'</SAMP>.  If you want to maintain several releases in
parallel, you need to use a branch (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>).

The revision numbers live a life of their own.  They
need not have anything at all to do with the release
numbers of your software product.  Depending
on how you use CVS the revision numbers might change several times
between two releases.  As an example, some of the
source files that make up RCS 5.6 have the following
revision numbers:

You can use the <CODE>tag</CODE> command to give a symbolic name to a
certain revision of a file.  You can use the <SAMP>`-v'</SAMP> flag to the
<CODE>status</CODE> command to see all tags that a file has, and
which revision numbers they represent.  Tag names must
start with an uppercase or lowercase letter and can
contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits,
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  The two tag names <CODE>BASE</CODE>
and <CODE>HEAD</CODE> are reserved for use by CVS.  It
is expected that future names which are special to
CVS will be specially named, for example by
starting with <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>, rather than being named analogously to
<CODE>BASE</CODE> and <CODE>HEAD</CODE>, to avoid conflicts with
actual tag names.

</P>
<P>
You'll want to choose some convention for naming tags,
based on information such as the name of the program
and the version number of the release.  For example,
one might take the name of the program, immediately
followed by the version number with <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> changed to
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, so that CVS 1.9 would be tagged with the name
<CODE>cvs1-9</CODE>.  If you choose a consistent convention,
then you won't constantly be guessing whether a tag is
<CODE>cvs-1-9</CODE> or <CODE>cvs1_9</CODE> or what.  You might
even want to consider enforcing your convention in the
taginfo file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC72">User-defined logging</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
The following example shows how you can add a tag to a
file.  The commands must be issued inside your working

<P>
When you tag more than one file with the same tag you
can think about the tag as "a curve drawn through a
matrix of filename vs. revision number."  Say we have 5
files with the following revisions:

</P>

<PRE>
	file1   file2   file3   file4   file5

	1.1     1.1     1.1     1.1  /--1.1*      &#60;-*-  TAG
	1.2*-   1.2     1.2    -1.2*-
	1.3  \- 1.3*-   1.3   / 1.3
	1.4          \  1.4  /  1.4
		      \-1.5*-   1.5
			1.6
</PRE>

<P>
At some time in the past, the <CODE>*</CODE> versions were tagged.
You can think of the tag as a handle attached to the curve
drawn through the tagged revisions.  When you pull on
the handle, you get all the tagged revisions.  Another
way to look at it is that you "sight" through a set of
revisions that is "flat" along the tagged revisions,
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
	file1   file2   file3   file4   file5

			1.1
			1.2
		1.1     1.3                       _

<A NAME="IDX199"></A>

</P>

<P>
Sometimes a working copy's revision has extra data
associated with it, for example it might be on a branch
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>), or restricted to
versions prior to a certain date by <SAMP>`checkout -D'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`update -D'</SAMP>.  Because this data persists --
that is, it applies to subsequent commands in the
working copy -- we refer to it as <STRONG>sticky</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
Most of the time, stickiness is an obscure aspect of
CVS that you don't need to think about.  However,
even if you don't want to use the feature, you may need
to know <EM>something</EM> about sticky tags (for
example, how to avoid them!).

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>status</CODE> command to see if any
sticky tags or dates are set:

</P>

$ cvs status driver.c

The sticky tags will remain on your working files until
you delete them with <SAMP>`cvs update -A'</SAMP>.  The
<SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> option retrieves the version of the file from
the head of the trunk, and forgets any sticky tags,
dates, or options.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
The most common use of sticky tags is to identify which
branch one is working on, as described in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC52">Accessing branches</A>.  However, non-branch
sticky tags have uses as well.  For example,
suppose that you want to avoid updating your working
directory, to isolate yourself from possibly
destabilizing changes other people are making.  You
can, of course, just refrain from running <CODE>cvs
update</CODE>.  But if you want to avoid updating only a
portion of a larger tree, then sticky tags can help.
If you check out a certain revision (such as 1.4) it
will become sticky.  Subsequent <CODE>cvs update</CODE>
commands will
not retrieve the latest revision until you reset the
tag with <CODE>cvs update -A</CODE>.  Likewise, use of the
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option to <CODE>update</CODE> or <CODE>checkout</CODE>
sets a <STRONG>sticky date</STRONG>, which, similarly, causes that
date to be used for future retrievals.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
Many times you will want to retrieve an old version of
a file without setting a sticky tag.  The way to do
that is with the <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> option to <CODE>checkout</CODE> or
<CODE>update</CODE>, which sends the contents of the file to
standard output.  For example, suppose you have a file
named <TT>`file1'</TT> which existed as revision 1.1, and
you then removed it (thus adding a dead revision 1.2).
Now suppose you want to add it again, with the same
contents it had previously.  Here is how to do it:

</P>

<PRE>

CVS allows you to isolate changes onto a separate
line of development, known as a <STRONG>branch</STRONG>.  When you
change files on a branch, those changes do not appear
on the main trunk or other branches.

</P>
<P>
Later you can move changes from one branch to another
branch (or the main trunk) by <STRONG>merging</STRONG>.  Merging
involves first running <CODE>cvs update -j</CODE>, to merge
the changes into the working directory.
You can then commit that revision, and thus effectively
copy the changes onto another branch.

Suppose that release 1.0 of tc has been made.  You are continuing to
develop tc, planning to create release 1.1 in a couple of months.  After a
while your customers start to complain about a fatal bug.  You check
out release 1.0 (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC47">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>) and find the bug
(which turns out to have a trivial fix).  However, the current revision
of the sources are in a state of flux and are not expected to be stable
for at least another month.  There is no way to make a
bugfix release based on the newest sources.

</P>
<P>
The thing to do in a situation like this is to create a <STRONG>branch</STRONG> on
the revision trees for all the files that make up
release 1.0 of tc.  You can then make
modifications to the branch without disturbing the main trunk.  When the
modifications are finished you can elect to either incorporate them on
the main trunk, or leave them on the branch.

You can create a branch with <CODE>tag -b</CODE>; for
example, assuming you're in a working copy:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs tag -b rel-1-0-patches
</PRE>

<P>
This splits off a branch based on the current revisions
in the working copy, assigning that branch the name
<SAMP>`rel-1-0-patches'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
It is important to understand that branches get created
in the repository, not in the working copy.  Creating a
branch based on current revisions, as the above example
does, will <EM>not</EM> automatically switch the working
copy to be on the new branch.  For information on how
to do that, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC52">Accessing branches</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also create a branch without reference to any
working copy, by using <CODE>rtag</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs rtag -b -r rel-1-0 rel-1-0-patches tc
</PRE>

<P>
<SAMP>`-r rel-1-0'</SAMP> says that this branch should be
rooted at the revision that
corresponds to the tag <SAMP>`rel-1-0'</SAMP>.  It need not
be the most recent revision -- it's often useful to
split a branch off an old revision (for example, when
fixing a bug in a past release otherwise known to be
stable).

</P>
<P>
As with <SAMP>`tag'</SAMP>, the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> flag tells
<CODE>rtag</CODE> to create a branch (rather than just a
symbolic revision name).  Note that the numeric
revision number that matches <SAMP>`rel-1-0'</SAMP> will
probably be different from file to file.

</P>
<P>
So, the full effect of the command is to create a new
branch -- named <SAMP>`rel-1-0-patches'</SAMP> -- in module
<SAMP>`tc'</SAMP>, rooted in the revision tree at the point tagged
by <SAMP>`rel-1-0'</SAMP>.

<P>
You can retrieve a branch in one of two ways: by
checking it out fresh from the repository, or by
switching an existing working copy over to the branch.

</P>
<P>
To check out a branch from the repository, invoke
<SAMP>`checkout'</SAMP> with the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> flag, followed by
the tag name of the branch (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC51">Creating a branch</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -r rel-1-0-patches tc
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you already have a working copy, you can switch
it to a given branch with <SAMP>`update -r'</SAMP>:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs update -r rel-1-0-patches tc
</PRE>

<P>
or equivalently:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd tc
$ cvs update -r rel-1-0-patches
</PRE>

<P>
It does not matter if the working copy was originally
on the main trunk or on some other branch -- the above
command will switch it to the named branch.  And
similarly to a regular <SAMP>`update'</SAMP> command,
<SAMP>`update -r'</SAMP> merges any changes you have made,
notifying you of conflicts where they occur.

</P>
<P>
Once you have a working copy tied to a particular
branch, it remains there until you tell it otherwise.
This means that changes checked in from the working
copy will add new revisions on that branch, while
leaving the main trunk and other branches unaffected.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
To find out what branch a working copy is on, you can
use the <SAMP>`status'</SAMP> command.  In its output, look for
the field named <SAMP>`Sticky tag'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>)
-- that's CVS's way of telling you the branch, if
any, of the current working files:

<P>
Don't be confused by the fact that the branch numbers
for each file are different (<SAMP>`1.7.2'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`1.4.2'</SAMP> respectively).  The branch tag is the
same, <SAMP>`rel-1-0-patches'</SAMP>, and the files are
indeed on the same branch.  The numbers simply reflect
the point in each file's revision history at which the
branch was made.  In the above example, one can deduce
that <SAMP>`driver.c'</SAMP> had been through more changes than
<SAMP>`backend.c'</SAMP> before this branch was created.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC53">Branches and revisions</A> for details about how
branch numbers are constructed.

Ordinarily, a file's revision history is a linear

</PRE>

<P>
However, CVS is not limited to linear development.  The
<STRONG>revision tree</STRONG> can be split into <STRONG>branches</STRONG>,
where each branch is a self-maintained line of
development.  Changes made on one branch can easily be
moved back to the main trunk.

</P>
<P>
Each branch has a <STRONG>branch number</STRONG>, consisting of an
odd number of period-separated decimal integers.  The
branch number is created by appending an integer to the
revision number where the corresponding branch forked
off.  Having branch numbers allows more than one branch
to be forked off from a certain revision.

</P>
<P>
All revisions on a branch have revision numbers formed
by appending an ordinal number to the branch number.
The following figure illustrates branching with an
example.

</PRE>

<P>
The exact details of how the branch number is
constructed is not something you normally need to be
concerned about, but here is how it works: When
CVS creates a branch number it picks the first
unused even integer, starting with 2.  So when you want
to create a branch from revision 6.4 it will be
numbered 6.4.2.  All branch numbers ending in a zero
(such as 6.4.0) are used internally by CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC54">Magic branch numbers</A>).  The branch 1.1.1 has a
special meaning.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC98">Tracking third-party sources</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC54">Magic branch numbers</A></H2>

<P>
This section describes a CVS feature called
<STRONG>magic branches</STRONG>.  For most purposes, you need not
worry about magic branches; CVS handles them for
you.  However, they are visible to you in certain
circumstances, so it may be useful to have some idea of
how it works.

</P>
<P>
Externally, branch numbers consist of an odd number of
dot-separated decimal integers.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC44">Revision numbers</A>.  That is not the whole truth, however.  For
efficiency reasons CVS sometimes inserts an extra 0
in the second rightmost position (1.2.4 becomes
1.2.0.4, 8.9.10.11.12 becomes 8.9.10.11.0.12 and so
on).

</P>
<P>
CVS does a pretty good job at hiding these so
called magic branches, but in a few places the hiding
is incomplete:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The magic branch number appears in the output from
<CODE>cvs log</CODE>.

<LI>

You cannot specify a symbolic branch name to <CODE>cvs
admin</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>admin</CODE> command to reassign a
symbolic name to a branch the way RCS expects it
to be.  If <CODE>R4patches</CODE> is assigned to the branch
1.4.2 (magic branch number 1.4.0.2) in file
<TT>`numbers.c'</TT> you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -NR4patches:1.4.2 numbers.c
</PRE>

<P>
It only works if at least one revision is already
committed on the branch.  Be very careful so that you
do not assign the tag to the wrong number.  (There is
no way to see how the tag was assigned yesterday).

You can merge changes made on a branch into your working copy by giving
the <SAMP>`-j <VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag to the <CODE>update</CODE> command.  With one

<P>
The branch 1.2.2 has been given the tag (symbolic name) <SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP>.  The
following example assumes that the module <SAMP>`mod'</SAMP> contains only one
file, <TT>`m.c'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout mod               # Retrieve the latest revision, 1.4

$ cvs update -j R1fix m.c        # Merge all changes made on the branch,
				 # i.e. the changes between revision 1.2
				 # and 1.2.2.2, into your working copy
				 # of the file.

$ cvs commit -m "Included R1fix" # Create revision 1.5.
</PRE>

<P>
A conflict can result from a merge operation.  If that
happens, you should resolve it before committing the
new revision.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC80">Conflicts example</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>checkout</CODE> command also supports the <SAMP>`-j <VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag.  The
same effect as above could be achieved with this:

$ cvs checkout -j R1fix mod
$ cvs commit -m "Included R1fix"

<H2><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC56">Merging from a branch several times</A></H2>

Continuing our example, the revision tree now looks
like this:

Branch R1fix -&#62; +---! 1.2.2.1 !----! 1.2.2.2 !
		    +---------+    +---------+

<P>
where the starred line represents the merge from the
<SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP> branch to the main trunk, as just
discussed.

</P>
<P>
Now suppose that development continues on the
<SAMP>`R1fix'</SAMP> branch:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+
! 1.1 !----! 1.2 !----! 1.3 !----! 1.4 !----! 1.5 !   &#60;- The main trunk

		    +---------+    +---------+    +---------+
</PRE>

<P>
and then you want to merge those new changes onto the
main trunk.  If you just use the <CODE>cvs update -j
R1fix m.c</CODE> command again, CVS will attempt to
merge again the changes which you have already merged,
which can have undesirable side effects.

</P>
<P>
So instead you need to specify that you only want to
merge the changes on the branch which have not yet been
merged into the trunk.  To do that you specify two
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, and CVS merges the changes from
the first revision to the second revision.  For
example, in this case the simplest way would be

</P>

<PRE>
cvs update -j 1.2.2.2 -j R1fix m.c    # Merge changes from 1.2.2.2 to the
				      # head of the R1fix branch
</PRE>

<P>
The problem with this is that you need to specify the
1.2.2.2 revision manually.  A slightly better approach
might be to use the date the last merge was done:

If you try to use this option when operating on

If no arguments are given to <CODE>update</CODE> it will

<H1><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC60">Adding, removing, and renaming files and directories</A></H1>

<P>
In the course of a project, one will often add new
files.  Likewise with removing or renaming, or with
directories.  The general concept to keep in mind in
all these cases is that instead of making an
irreversible change you want CVS to record the
fact that a change has taken place, just as with
modifying an existing file.  The exact mechanisms to do
this in CVS vary depending on the situation.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC61">Adding files to a directory</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>

</P>
<P>
To add a new file to a directory, follow these steps.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You must have a working copy of the directory.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC5">Getting the source</A>.

<LI>

Create the new file inside your working copy of the directory.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs add <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to tell CVS that you
want to version control the file.  If the file contains
binary data, specify <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC74">Handling binary files</A>).

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs commit <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to actually check
in the file into the repository.  Other developers
cannot see the file until you perform this step.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the <CODE>add</CODE> command to add a new
directory.

</P>
<P>
Unlike most other commands, the <CODE>add</CODE> command is
not recursive.  You cannot even type <SAMP>`cvs add
foo/bar'</SAMP>!  Instead, you have to

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd foo
$ cvs add bar
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs add</B> <I>[<CODE>-k</CODE> kflag] [<CODE>-m</CODE> message] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX251"></A>

<P>
Schedule <VAR>files</VAR> to be added to the repository.
The files or directories specified with <CODE>add</CODE> must
already exist in the current directory.  To add a whole
new directory hierarchy to the source repository (for
example, files received from a third-party vendor), use
the <CODE>import</CODE> command instead.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC130">import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</A>.

</P>
<P>
The added files are not placed in the source repository
until you use <CODE>commit</CODE> to make the change
permanent.  Doing an <CODE>add</CODE> on a file that was
removed with the <CODE>remove</CODE> command will undo the
effect of the <CODE>remove</CODE>, unless a <CODE>commit</CODE>
command intervened.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC62">Removing files</A>, for an
example.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option specifies the default way that
this file will be checked out; for more information see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC96">Substitution modes</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option specifies a description for the
file.  This description appears in the history log (if
it is enabled, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC171">The history file</A>).  It will also be
saved in the version history inside the repository when
the file is committed.  The <CODE>log</CODE> command displays
this description.  The description can be changed using
<SAMP>`admin -t'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC113">admin--Administration</A>.  If you omit the
<SAMP>`-m <VAR>description</VAR>'</SAMP> flag, an empty string will
be used.  You will not be prompted for a description.
</P>
</DL>

<P>
For example, the following commands add the file
<TT>`backend.c'</TT> to the repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs add backend.c
$ cvs commit -m "Early version. Not yet compilable." backend.c
</PRE>

<P>
When you add a file it is added only on the branch
which you are working on (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>).  You can
later merge the additions to another branch if you want
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC58">Merging can add or remove files</A>).

<P>
Modules change.  New files are added, and old files
disappear.  Still, you want to be able to retrieve an
exact copy of old releases.

</P>
<P>
Here is what you can do to remove a file,
but remain able to retrieve old revisions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that you have not made any uncommitted
modifications to the file.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC8">Viewing differences</A>,
for one way to do that.  You can also use the
<CODE>status</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> command.  If you remove
the file without committing your changes, you will of
course not be able to retrieve the file as it was
immediately before you deleted it.

<LI>

Remove the file from your working copy of the directory.
You can for instance use <CODE>rm</CODE>.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs remove <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to tell CVS that
you really want to delete the file.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs commit <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to actually
perform the removal of the file from the repository.
</UL>

<P>
When you commit the removal of the file, CVS
records the fact that the file no longer exists.  It is
possible for a file to exist on only some branches and
not on others, or to re-add another file with the same
name later.  CVS will correctly create or not create
the file, based on the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options
specified to <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs remove</B> <I>[options] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX255"></A>

<P>
Schedule file(s) to be removed from the repository
(files which have not already been removed from the
working directory are not processed).  This command
does not actually remove the file from the repository
until you commit the removal.  For a full list of
options, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC151">Quick reference to CVS commands</A>.
</P>
</DL>

<P>
Here is an example of removing several files:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd test
$ rm *.c
$ cvs remove
cvs remove: Removing .
cvs remove: scheduling a.c for removal
cvs remove: scheduling b.c for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove these files permanently
$ cvs ci -m "Removed unneeded files"
cvs commit: Examining .
cvs commit: Committing .
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience you can remove the file and <CODE>cvs
remove</CODE> it in one step, by specifying the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>
option.  For example, the above example could also be
done like this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd test
$ cvs remove -f *.c
cvs remove: scheduling a.c for removal
cvs remove: scheduling b.c for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove these files permanently
$ cvs ci -m "Removed unneeded files"
cvs commit: Examining .
cvs commit: Committing .
</PRE>

<P>
If you execute <CODE>remove</CODE> for a file, and then
change your mind before you commit, you can undo the
<CODE>remove</CODE> with an <CODE>add</CODE> command.

</P>


<PRE>
$ ls
CVS   ja.h  oj.c
$ rm oj.c
$ cvs remove oj.c
cvs remove: scheduling oj.c for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove this file permanently
$ cvs add oj.c
U oj.c
cvs add: oj.c, version 1.1.1.1, resurrected
</PRE>

<P>
If you realize your mistake before you run the
<CODE>remove</CODE> command you can use <CODE>update</CODE> to
resurrect the file:

</P>

<PRE>
$ rm oj.c
$ cvs update oj.c
cvs update: warning: oj.c was lost
U oj.c
</PRE>

<P>
When you remove a file it is removed only on the branch
which you are working on (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>).  You can
later merge the removals to another branch if you want
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC58">Merging can add or remove files</A>).

<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC63">Removing directories</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>

</P>
<P>
In concept removing directories is somewhat similar to
removing files--you want the directory to not exist in
your current working directories, but you also want to
be able to retrieve old releases in which the directory
existed.

</P>
<P>
The way that you remove a directory is to remove all
the files in it.  You don't remove the directory
itself; there is no way to do that.
Instead you specify the <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>, <CODE>cvs checkout</CODE>, or <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>, which will cause CVS to remove empty
directories from working directories.  Probably the
best way to do this is to always specify <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>; if
you want an empty directory then put a dummy file (for
example <TT>`.keepme'</TT>) in it to prevent <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> from
removing it.

</P>
<P>
Note that <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> is implied by the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
options of <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>export</CODE>.  This way
CVS will be able to correctly create the directory
or not depending on whether the particular version you
are checking out contains any files in that directory.

Moving files to a different directory or renaming them
is not difficult, but some of the ways in which this
works may be non-obvious.  (Moving or renaming a
directory is even harder.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC68">Moving and renaming directories</A>.).

</P>
<P>
The examples below assume that the file <VAR>old</VAR> is renamed to
<VAR>new</VAR>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC65">The Normal way to Rename</A></H3>

<P>
The normal way to move a file is to copy <VAR>old</VAR> to
<VAR>new</VAR>, and then issue the normal CVS commands
to remove <VAR>old</VAR> from the repository, and add
<VAR>new</VAR> to it.

</P>

<PRE>
$ mv <VAR>old</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>
$ cvs remove <VAR>old</VAR>
$ cvs add <VAR>new</VAR>
$ cvs commit -m "Renamed <VAR>old</VAR> to <VAR>new</VAR>" <VAR>old</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This is the simplest way to move a file, it is not
error-prone, and it preserves the history of what was
done.  Note that to access the history of the file you
must specify the old or the new name, depending on what
portion of the history you are accessing.  For example,
<CODE>cvs log <VAR>old</VAR></CODE> will give the log up until the
time of the rename.

</P>
<P>
When <VAR>new</VAR> is committed its revision numbers will
start again, usually at 1.1, so if that bothers you,
use the <SAMP>`-r rev'</SAMP> option to commit.  For more
information see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC46">Assigning revisions</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC66">Moving the history file</A></H3>

<P>
This method is more dangerous, since it involves moving
files inside the repository.  Read this entire section
before trying it out!

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old</VAR>,v <VAR>new</VAR>,v

<P>
Advantages:

<UL>
<LI>

The log of changes is maintained intact.

<LI>

The revision numbers are not affected.
</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Old releases of the module cannot easily be fetched from the
repository.  (The file will show up as <VAR>new</VAR> even
in revisions from the time before it was renamed).

<LI>

There is no log information of when the file was renamed.

<LI>

Nasty things might happen if someone accesses the history file
while you are moving it.  Make sure no one else runs any of the CVS
commands while you move it.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC67">Copying the history file</A></H3>

<P>
This way also involves direct modifications to the
repository.  It is safe, but not without drawbacks.

their changes, and remove their working copies of the
module, before you take the steps below.

Rename the directory inside the repository.


<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old-dir</VAR> <VAR>new-dir</VAR>

<P>
If someone had a working copy of the module the CVS commands will
cease to work for him, until he removes the directory
that disappeared inside the repository.

</P>
<P>
It is almost always better to move the files in the

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC72">User-defined logging</A></H2>

<P>
You can customize CVS to log various kinds of
actions, in whatever manner you choose.  These
mechanisms operate by executing a script at various
times.  The script might append a message to a file
listing the information and the programmer who created
it, or send mail to a group of developers, or, perhaps,
post a message to a particular newsgroup.  To log
commits, use the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC166">Loginfo</A>).
To log commits, checkouts, exports, and tags,
respectively, you can also use the <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> options in the
modules file.  For a more flexible way of giving
notifications to various users, which requires less in
the way of keeping centralized scripts up to date, use
the <CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC85">Telling CVS to notify you</A>); this command is useful even if you are not

The <TT>`taginfo'</TT> file defines programs to execute

for administrative files (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC152">Reference manual for Administrative files</A>), where each line is a regular expression
followed by a command to execute.  The arguments passed
to the command are, in order, the <VAR>tagname</VAR>,
<VAR>operation</VAR> (<CODE>add</CODE> for <CODE>tag</CODE>,
<CODE>mov</CODE> for <CODE>tag -F</CODE>, and <CODE>del</CODE> for

<H1><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC74">Handling binary files</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX271"></A>

</P>
<P>
The most common use for CVS is to store text
files.  With text files, CVS can merge revisions,
display the differences between revisions in a
human-visible fashion, and other such operations.
However, if you are willing to give up a few of these
abilities, CVS can store binary files.  For
example, one might store a web site in CVS
including both text files and binary images.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC75">The issues with binary files</A></H2>

<P>
While the need to manage binary files may seem obvious
if the files that you customarily work with are binary,
putting them into version control does present some
additional issues.

</P>
<P>
One basic function of version control is to show the
differences between two revisions.  For example, if
someone else checked in a new version of a file, you
may wish to look at what they changed and determine
whether their changes are good.  For text files,
CVS provides this functionality via the <CODE>cvs
diff</CODE> command.  For binary files, it may be possible to
extract the two revisions and then compare them with a
tool external to CVS (for example, word processing
software often has such a feature).  If there is no
such tool, one must track changes via other mechanisms,
such as urging people to write good log messages, and
hoping that the changes they actually made were the
changes that they intended to make.

</P>
<P>
Another ability of a version control system is the
ability to merge two revisions.  For CVS this
happens in two contexts.  The first is when users make
changes in separate working directories
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC77">Multiple developers</A>).  The second is when one
merges explicitly with the <SAMP>`update -j'</SAMP> command
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>).

</P>
<P>
In the case of text
files, CVS can merge changes made independently,
and signal a conflict if the changes conflict.  With
binary files, the best that CVS can do is present
the two different copies of the file, and leave it to
the user to resolve the conflict.  The user may choose
one copy or the other, or may run an external merge
tool which knows about that particular file format, if
one exists.
Note that having the user merge relies primarily on the
user to not accidentally omit some changes, and thus is
potentially error prone.

</P>
<P>
If this process is thought to be undesirable, the best
choice may be to avoid merging.  To avoid the merges
that result from separate working directories, see the
discussion of reserved checkouts (file locking) in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC77">Multiple developers</A>.  To avoid the merges
resulting from branches, restrict use of branches.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC76" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC76">How to store binary files</A></H2>

<P>
There are two issues with using CVS to store
binary files.  The first is that CVS by default
converts line endings between the canonical form in
which they are stored in the repository (linefeed
only), and the form appropriate to the operating system
in use on the client (for example, carriage return
followed by line feed for Windows NT).

</P>
<P>
The second is that a binary file might happen to
contain data which looks like a keyword (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>), so keyword expansion must be turned
off.

</P>

<P>
The <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> option available with some CVS
commands insures that neither line ending conversion
nor keyword expansion will be done.

</P>
<P>
Here is an example of how you can create a new file
using the <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> flag:

</P>

<PRE>
$ echo '&#36;Id$' &#62; kotest
$ cvs add -kb -m"A test file" kotest
$ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
</PRE>

<P>
If a file accidentally gets added without <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>,
one can use the <CODE>cvs admin</CODE> command to recover.
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
$ echo '&#36;Id$' &#62; kotest
$ cvs add -m"A test file" kotest
$ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
$ cvs admin -kb kotest
$ cvs update -A kotest
# For non-unix systems:
# Copy in a good copy of the file from outside CVS
$ cvs commit -m "make it binary" kotest
</PRE>

<P>
When you check in the file <TT>`kotest'</TT> the file is
not preserved as a binary file, because you did not
check it in as a binary file.  The <CODE>cvs
admin -kb</CODE> command sets the default keyword
substitution method for this file, but it does not
alter the working copy of the file that you have.  If you need to
cope with line endings (that is, you are using
CVS on a non-unix system), then you need to
check in a new copy of the file, as shown by the
<CODE>cvs commit</CODE> command above.
On unix, the <CODE>cvs update -A</CODE> command suffices.

</P>
<P>
However, in using <CODE>cvs admin -k</CODE> to change the
keyword expansion, be aware that the keyword expansion
mode is not version controlled.  This means that, for
example, that if you have a text file in old releases,
and a binary file with the same name in new releases,
CVS provides no way to check out the file in text
or binary mode depending on what version you are
checking out.  There is no good workaround for this
problem.

</P>
<P>
You can also set a default for whether <CODE>cvs add</CODE>
and <CODE>cvs import</CODE> treat a file as binary based on
its name; for example you could say that files who
names end in <SAMP>`.exe'</SAMP> are binary.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC159">The cvswrappers file</A>.
There is currently no way to have CVS detect
whether a file is binary based on its contents.  The
main difficulty with designing such a feature is that
it is not clear how to distinguish between binary and
non-binary files, and the rules to apply would vary
considerably with the operating system.

When more than one person works on a software project
things often get complicated.  Often, two people try to
edit the same file simultaneously.  One solution, known
as <STRONG>file locking</STRONG> or <STRONG>reserved checkouts</STRONG>, is
to allow only one person to edit each file at a time.
This is the only solution with some version control
systems, including RCS and SCCS.  Currently
the usual way to get reserved checkouts with CVS
is the <CODE>cvs admin -l</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC114">admin options</A>).  This is not as nicely integrated into
CVS as the watch features, described below, but it
seems that most people with a need for reserved
checkouts find it adequate.
It also may be possible to use the watches
features described below, together with suitable
procedures (not enforced by software), to avoid having
two people edit at the same time.

</P>
<P>
The default model with CVS is known as
<STRONG>unreserved checkouts</STRONG>.  In this model, developers
can edit their own <STRONG>working copy</STRONG> of a file
simultaneously.  The first person that commits his
changes has no automatic way of knowing that another
has started to edit it.  Others will get an error
message when they try to commit the file.  They must
then use CVS commands to bring their working copy
up to date with the repository revision.  This process
is almost automatic.

</P>
<P>
CVS also supports mechanisms which facilitate
various kinds of communcation, without actually
enforcing rules like reserved checkouts do.

</P>
<P>
The rest of this chapter describes how these various
models work, and some of the issues involved in
choosing between them.

<H2><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC78">File status</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
<A NAME="IDX281"></A>

</P>
<P>
Based on what operations you have performed on a
checked out file, and what operations others have
performed to that file in the repository, one can
classify a file in a number of states.  The states, as
reported by the <CODE>status</CODE> command, are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Up-to-date
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>

The file is identical with the latest revision in the
repository for the branch in use.

<DT>Locally Modified
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX283"></A>
You have edited the file, and not yet committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Added
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>
You have added the file with <CODE>add</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Removed
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX285"></A>
You have removed the file with <CODE>remove</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Needs Checkout
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX286"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
repository.  The name is slightly misleading; you will
ordinarily use <CODE>update</CODE> rather than
<CODE>checkout</CODE> to get that newer revision.

<DT>Needs Patch
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send
a patch rather than the entire file.  Sending a patch or
sending an entire file accomplishes the same thing.

<DT>Needs Merge
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository, and you
have also made modifications to the file.

<DT>File had conflicts on merge
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous
<CODE>update</CODE> command gave a conflict.  If you have not
already done so, you need to
resolve the conflict as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC80">Conflicts example</A>.

<DT>Unknown
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
CVS doesn't know anything about this file.  For
example, you have created a new file and have not run
<CODE>add</CODE>.

</DL>

<P>
To help clarify the file status, <CODE>status</CODE> also
reports the <CODE>Working revision</CODE> which is the
revision that the file in the working directory derives
from, and the <CODE>Repository revision</CODE> which is the
latest revision in the repository for the branch in
use.

</P>
<P>
The options to <CODE>status</CODE> are listed in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC151">Quick reference to CVS commands</A>.  For information on its <CODE>Sticky tag</CODE>
and <CODE>Sticky date</CODE> output, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>.
For information on its <CODE>Sticky options</CODE> output,
see the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC149">update options</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can think of the <CODE>status</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE>
commands as somewhat complementary.  You use
<CODE>update</CODE> to bring your files up to date, and you
can use <CODE>status</CODE> to give you some idea of what an
<CODE>update</CODE> would do (of course, the state of the
repository might change before you actually run
<CODE>update</CODE>).  In fact, if you want a command to
display file status in a more brief format than is
displayed by the <CODE>status</CODE> command, you can invoke

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>

<PRE>
$ cvs -n -q update
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> option means to not actually do the
update, but merely to display statuses; the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP>
option avoids printing the name of each directory.  For
more information on the <CODE>update</CODE> command, and
these options, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC151">Quick reference to CVS commands</A>.

<A NAME="IDX292"></A>
<A NAME="IDX293"></A>
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you want to update or merge a file, use the <CODE>update</CODE>
command.  For files that are not up to date this is roughly equivalent
to a <CODE>checkout</CODE> command: the newest revision of the file is
extracted from the repository and put in your working copy of the
module.

</P>
<P>
Your modifications to a file are never lost when you
use <CODE>update</CODE>.  If no newer revision exists,
running <CODE>update</CODE> has no effect.  If you have
edited the file, and a newer revision is available,
CVS will merge all changes into your working copy.

</P>
<P>
For instance, imagine that you checked out revision 1.4 and started
editing it.  In the meantime someone else committed revision 1.5, and
shortly after that revision 1.6.  If you run <CODE>update</CODE> on the file
now, CVS will incorporate all changes between revision 1.4 and 1.6 into
your file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
If any of the changes between 1.4 and 1.6 were made too
close to any of the changes you have made, an
<STRONG>overlap</STRONG> occurs.  In such cases a warning is
printed, and the resulting file includes both
versions of the lines that overlap, delimited by
special markers.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC148">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>, for a complete description of the
<CODE>update</CODE> command.

For your protection, CVS will refuse to check in a
file if a conflict occurred and you have not resolved
the conflict.  Currently to resolve a conflict, you
must change the timestamp on the file.  In previous
versions of CVS, you also needed to
insure that the file contains no conflict markers.
Because
your file may legitimately contain conflict markers (that
is, occurrences of <SAMP>`&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; '</SAMP> at the start of a
line that don't mark a conflict), the current
version of CVS will print a warning and proceed to
check in the file.

If you use release 1.04 or later of pcl-cvs (a GNU

<P>
For many groups, use of CVS in its default mode is
perfectly satisfactory.  Users may sometimes go to
check in a modification only to find that another
modification has intervened, but they deal with it and
proceed with their check in.  Other groups prefer to be
able to know who is editing what files, so that if two
people try to edit the same file they can choose to
talk about who is doing what when rather than be
surprised at check in time.  The features in this
section allow such coordination, while retaining the
ability of two developers to edit the same file at the
same time.

</P>
<P>
For maximum benefit developers should use <CODE>cvs
edit</CODE> (not <CODE>chmod</CODE>) to make files read-write to

<H3><A NAME="SEC85" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC85">Telling CVS to notify you</A></H3>

<P>
You can tell CVS that you want to receive
notifications about various actions taken on a file.
You can do this without using <CODE>cvs watch on</CODE> for
the file, but generally you will want to use <CODE>cvs
watch on</CODE>, so that developers use the <CODE>cvs edit</CODE>
command.

<P>
Add the current user to the list of people to receive notification of
work done on <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-a</CODE> option specifies what kinds of events CVS should notify
the user about.  <VAR>action</VAR> is one of the following:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>edit</CODE>
<DD>
Another user has applied the <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command (described
below) to a file.

<DT><CODE>unedit</CODE>
<DD>
Another user has applied the <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> command (described
below) or the <CODE>cvs release</CODE> command to a file, or has deleted
the file and allowed <CODE>cvs update</CODE> to recreate it.

<DT><CODE>commit</CODE>
<DD>
Another user has committed changes to a file.

<DT><CODE>all</CODE>
<DD>
All of the above.

<DT><CODE>none</CODE>
<DD>
None of the above.  (This is useful with <CODE>cvs edit</CODE>,
described below.)

</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>-a</CODE> option may appear more than once, or not at all.  If
omitted, the action defaults to <CODE>all</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and options are processed as for the
<CODE>cvs watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs watch remove</B> <I>[<CODE>-a</CODE> action] [<CODE>-lR</CODE>] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX327"></A>

<P>
Remove a notification request established using <CODE>cvs watch add</CODE>;
the arguments are the same.  If the <CODE>-a</CODE> option is present, only
watches for the specified actions are removed.

</P>
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX328"></A>
When the conditions exist for notification, CVS
calls the <TT>`notify'</TT> administrative file.  Edit
<TT>`notify'</TT> as one edits the other administrative
files (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>).  This
file follows the usual conventions for administrative
files (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC161">The common syntax</A>), where each line is a regular
expression followed by a command to execute.  The
command should contain a single ocurrence of <SAMP>`%s'</SAMP>
which will be replaced by the user to notify; the rest
of the information regarding the notification will be
supplied to the command on standard input.  The
standard thing to put in the <CODE>notify</CODE> file is the
single line:

</P>

<PRE>
ALL mail %s -s \"CVS notification\"
</PRE>

<P>
This causes users to be notified by electronic mail.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
Note that if you set this up in the straightforward
way, users receive notifications on the server machine.
One could of course write a <TT>`notify'</TT> script which
directed notifications elsewhere, but to make this
easy, CVS allows you to associate a notification
address for each user.  To do so create a file
<TT>`users'</TT> in <TT>`CVSROOT'</TT> with a line for each
user in the format <VAR>user</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR>.  Then
instead of passing the name of the user to be notified
to <TT>`notify'</TT>, CVS will pass the <VAR>value</VAR>
(normally an email address on some other machine).

</P>
<P>
CVS does not notify you for your own changes.
Currently this check is done based on whether the user
name of the person taking the action which triggers
notification matches the user name of the person
getting notification.  In fact, in general, the watches
features only track one edit by each user.  It probably
would be more useful if watches tracked each working
directory separately, so this behavior might be worth
changing.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC86" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC86">How to edit a file which is being watched</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
Since a file which is being watched is checked out
read-only, you cannot simply edit it.  To make it
read-write, and inform others that you are planning to
edit it, use the <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command.  Some systems
call this a <STRONG>checkout</STRONG>, but CVS uses that term
for obtaining a copy of the sources (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC5">Getting the source</A>), an operation which those systems call a
<STRONG>get</STRONG> or a <STRONG>fetch</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs edit</B> <I>[options] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX332"></A>

<P>
Prepare to edit the working files <VAR>files</VAR>.  CVS makes the
<VAR>files</VAR> read-write, and notifies users who have requested
<CODE>edit</CODE> notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command accepts the same <VAR>options</VAR> as the
<CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command, and establishes a temporary watch for the
user on <VAR>files</VAR>; CVS will remove the watch when <VAR>files</VAR> are
<CODE>unedit</CODE>ed or <CODE>commit</CODE>ted.  If the user does not wish to
receive notifications, she should specify <CODE>-a none</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and options are processed as for the <CODE>cvs
watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Caution:</STRONG> If the <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE>
option is enabled in the repository (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC173">The CVSROOT/config configuration file</A>),
CVS will not change the permissions on any of the
<VAR>files</VAR>.  The reason for this change is to ensure
that using <SAMP>`cvs edit'</SAMP> does not interfere with the
ability to store file permissions in the CVS
repository.

</P>
</DL>

<P>
Normally when you are done with a set of changes, you
use the <CODE>cvs commit</CODE> command, which checks in your
changes and returns the watched files to their usual
read-only state.  But if you instead decide to abandon
your changes, or not to make any changes, you can use
the <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>

<P>
Abandon work on the working files <VAR>files</VAR>, and revert them to the
repository versions on which they are based.  CVS makes those
<VAR>files</VAR> read-only for which users have requested notification using
<CODE>cvs watch on</CODE>.  CVS notifies users who have requested <CODE>unedit</CODE>
notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and options are processed as for the
<CODE>cvs watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
If watches are not in use, the <CODE>unedit</CODE> command
probably does not work, and the way to revert to the
repository version is to remove the file and then use
<CODE>cvs update</CODE> to get a new copy.  The meaning is
not precisely the same; removing and updating may also
bring in some changes which have been made in the
repository since the last time you updated.
</P>
</DL>

<P>
When using client/server CVS, you can use the
<CODE>cvs edit</CODE> and <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> commands even if
CVS is unable to succesfully communicate with the
server; the notifications will be sent upon the next
successful CVS command.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX341"></A>
If you use the watch features on a repository, it
creates <TT>`CVS'</TT> directories in the repository and
stores the information about watches in that directory.
If you attempt to use CVS 1.6 or earlier with the
repository, you get an error message such as the
following (all on one line):

</P>

<PRE>
cvs update: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading:
No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
and your operation will likely be aborted.  To use the
watch features, you must upgrade all copies of CVS
which use that repository in local or server mode.  If
you cannot upgrade, use the <CODE>watch off</CODE> and
<CODE>watch remove</CODE> commands to remove all watches, and
that will restore the repository to a state which
CVS 1.6 can cope with.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC89">Choosing between reserved or unreserved checkouts</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>

</P>
<P>
Reserved and unreserved checkouts each have pros and
cons.  Let it be said that a lot of this is a matter of
opinion or what works given different groups' working
styles, but here is a brief description of some of the
issues.  There are many ways to organize a team of
developers.  CVS does not try to enforce a certain
organization.  It is a tool that can be used in several
ways.

</P>
<P>
Reserved checkouts can be very counter-productive.  If
two persons want to edit different parts of a file,
there may be no reason to prevent either of them from
doing so.  Also, it is common for someone to take out a
lock on a file, because they are planning to edit it,
but then forget to release the lock.

</P>
<P>
People, especially people who are familiar with
reserved checkouts, often wonder how often conflicts
occur if unreserved checkouts are used, and how
difficult they are to resolve.  The experience with
many groups is that they occur rarely and usually are
relatively straightforward to resolve.

</P>
<P>
The rarity of serious conflicts may be surprising, until one realizes
that they occur only when two developers disagree on the proper design
for a given section of code; such a disagreement suggests that the
team has not been communicating properly in the first place.  In order
to collaborate under <EM>any</EM> source management regimen, developers
must agree on the general design of the system; given this agreement,
overlapping changes are usually straightforward to merge.

</P>
<P>
In some cases unreserved checkouts are clearly
inappropriate.  If no merge tool exists for the kind of
file you are managing (for example word processor files
or files edited by Computer Aided Design programs), and
it is not desirable to change to a program which uses a
mergeable data format, then resolving conflicts is
going to be unpleasant enough that you generally will
be better off to simply avoid the conflicts instead, by
using reserved checkouts.

</P>
<P>
The watches features described above in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC83">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>
can be considered to be an intermediate model between
reserved checkouts and unreserved checkouts.  When you
go to edit a file, it is possible to find out who else
is editing it.  And rather than having the system
simply forbid both people editing the file, it can tell
you what the situation is and let you figure out
whether it is a problem in that particular case or not.
Therefore, for some groups it can be considered the
best of both the reserved checkout and unreserved
checkout worlds.

<P>
If you have read this far, you probably have a pretty
good grasp on what CVS can do for you.  This
chapter talks a little about things that you still have
to decide.

</P>
<P>
If you are doing development on your own using CVS
you could probably skip this chapter.  The questions
this chapter takes up become more important when more

</P>
<P>
Your group should decide which policy to use regarding
commits.  Several policies are possible, and as your
experience with CVS grows you will probably find
out what works for you.

</P>
<P>
If you commit files too quickly you might commit files
that do not even compile.  If your partner updates his
working sources to include your buggy file, he will be
unable to compile the code.  On the other hand, other
persons will not be able to benefit from the
improvements you make to the code if you commit very
seldom, and conflicts will probably be more common.

</P>
<P>
It is common to only commit files after making sure
that they can be compiled.  Some sites require that the
files pass a test suite.  Policies like this can be
enforced using the commitinfo file
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC162">Commitinfo</A>), but you should think twice before
you enforce such a convention.  By making the
development environment too controlled it might become
too regimented and thus counter-productive to the real
goal, which is to get software written.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC92">Keyword substitution</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX347"></A>
<A NAME="IDX348"></A>
<A NAME="IDX349"></A>

</P>

<P>
As long as you edit source files inside your working
copy of a module you can always find out the state of
your files via <SAMP>`cvs status'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP>.
But as soon as you export the files from your
development environment it becomes harder to identify
which revisions they are.

</P>
<P>
CVS can use a mechanism known as <STRONG>keyword
substitution</STRONG> (or <STRONG>keyword expansion</STRONG>) to help
identifying the files.  Embedded strings of the form
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>$</CODE> and
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>:...$</CODE> in a file are replaced
with strings of the form
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR>$</CODE> whenever you obtain
a new revision of the file.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC93">Keyword List</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>

</P>

<P>
This is a list of the keywords:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>&#36;Author$</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX351"></A>

The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

<A NAME="IDX352"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Date$</CODE>
<DD>
The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

<A NAME="IDX353"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Header$</CODE>
<DD>
A standard header containing the full pathname of the
RCS file, the revision number, the date (UTC), the
author, the state, and the locker (if locked).  Files
will normally never be locked when you use CVS.

<A NAME="IDX354"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Id$</CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>&#36;Header$</CODE>, except that the RCS
filename is without a path.

<A NAME="IDX355"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Name$</CODE>
<DD>
Tag name used to check out this file.

<A NAME="IDX356"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Locker$</CODE>
<DD>
The login name of the user who locked the revision
(empty if not locked, and thus almost always useless
when you are using CVS).

<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE>
<DD>
The log message supplied during commit, preceded by a
header containing the RCS filename, the revision
number, the author, and the date (UTC). Existing log
messages are <EM>not</EM> replaced. Instead, the new log
message is inserted after <CODE>&#36;Log:...$</CODE>.
Each new line is prefixed with the same string which
precedes the <CODE>&#36;Log</CODE> keyword.  For example, if the
file contains


<PRE>
  /* Here is what people have been up to:
   *
   * &#36;Log: frob.c,v $
   * Revision 1.1  1997/01/03 14:23:51  joe
   * Add the superfrobnicate option
   *
   */
</PRE>

then additional lines which are added when expanding
the <CODE>&#36;Log</CODE> keyword will be preceded by <SAMP>`   * '</SAMP>.
Unlike previous versions of CVS and RCS, the
<STRONG>comment leader</STRONG> from the RCS file is not used.
The <CODE>&#36;Log</CODE> keyword is useful for
accumulating a complete change log in a source file,
but for several reasons it can be problematic.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC97">Problems with the &#36;Log$ keyword</A>.

<A NAME="IDX358"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;RCSfile$</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the RCS file without a path.

<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Revision$</CODE>
<DD>
The revision number assigned to the revision.

<A NAME="IDX360"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;Source$</CODE>
<DD>
The full pathname of the RCS file.

<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
<DT><CODE>&#36;State$</CODE>
<DD>
The state assigned to the revision.  States can be
assigned with <CODE>cvs admin -s</CODE>---see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC114">admin options</A>.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC94">Using keywords</A></H2>

<P>
To include a keyword string you simply include the
relevant text string, such as <CODE>&#36;Id$</CODE>, inside the
file, and commit the file.  CVS will automatically
expand the string as part of the commit operation.

</P>
<P>
It is common to embed the <CODE>&#36;Id$</CODE> string in
the source files so that it gets passed through to
generated files.  For example, if you are managing
computer program source code, you might include a
variable which is initialized to contain that string.
Or some C compilers may provide a <CODE>#pragma ident</CODE>
directive. Or a document management system might
provide a way to pass a string through to generated
files.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
The <CODE>ident</CODE> command (which is part of the RCS
package) can be used to extract keywords and their
values from a file.  This can be handy for text files,
but it is even more useful for extracting keywords from
binary files.

</P>

<PRE>
$ ident samp.c
samp.c:
     &#36;Id: samp.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $
$ gcc samp.c
$ ident a.out
a.out:
     &#36;Id: samp.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>
SCCS is another popular revision control system.
It has a command, <CODE>what</CODE>, which is very similar to
<CODE>ident</CODE> and used for the same purpose.  Many sites
without RCS have SCCS.  Since <CODE>what</CODE>
looks for the character sequence <CODE>@(#)</CODE> it is
easy to include keywords that are detected by either
command.  Simply prefix the RCS keyword with the
magic SCCS phrase, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
static char *id="@(#) &#36;Id: ab.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $";
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC95">Avoiding substitution</A></H2>

<P>
Keyword substitution has its disadvantages. Sometimes
you might want the literal text string
<SAMP>&#36;Author$</SAMP> to appear inside a file without
CVS interpreting it as a keyword and expanding it
into something like <SAMP>&#36;Author: ceder $</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
There is unfortunately no way to selectively turn off
keyword substitution.  You can use <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC96">Substitution modes</A>) to turn off keyword
substitution entirely.

</P>
<P>
In many cases you can avoid using keywords in
the source, even though they appear in the final
product.  For example, the source for this manual
contains <SAMP>`$@asis{}Author$'</SAMP> whenever the text
<SAMP>&#36;Author$</SAMP> should appear. In <CODE>nroff</CODE>
and <CODE>troff</CODE> you can embed the null-character
<CODE>\&#38;</CODE> inside the keyword for a similar effect.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC96">Substitution modes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX364"></A>
<A NAME="IDX365"></A>

</P>
<P>
Each file has a stored default substitution mode, and
each working directory copy of a file also has a
substitution mode.  The former is set by the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>
option to <CODE>cvs add</CODE> and <CODE>cvs admin</CODE>; the
latter is set by the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> options to <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> or <CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> also
has a <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option.  For some examples,
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC74">Handling binary files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The modes available are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate keyword strings using the default form, e.g.
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $ for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword.

<DT><SAMP>`-kkvl'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>, except that a locker's name is always
inserted if the given revision is currently locked.
This option is normally not useful when CVS is used.

<DT><SAMP>`-kk'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit
their values.  For example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword, generate the string <CODE>&#36;Revision$</CODE>
instead of <CODE>&#36;Revision: 5.7 $</CODE>.  This option
is useful to ignore differences due to keyword
substitution when comparing different revisions of a
file.

<DT><SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate the old keyword string, present in the working
file just before it was checked in.  For example, for
the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>&#36;Revision: 1.1 $</CODE> instead of
<CODE>&#36;Revision: 5.7 $</CODE> if that is how the
string appeared when the file was checked in.

<DT><SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>, but also inhibit conversion of line
endings between the canonical form in which they are
stored in the repository (linefeed only), and the form
appropriate to the operating system in use on the
client.  For systems, like unix, which use linefeed
only to terminate lines, this is the same as
<SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>.  For more information on binary files, see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC74">Handling binary files</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For
example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>5.7</CODE> instead of <CODE>&#36;Revision: 5.7 $</CODE>.
This can help generate files in programming languages
where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like
<CODE>&#36;Revision: $</CODE> from a string.  However,
further keyword substitution cannot be performed once
the keyword names are removed, so this option should be
used with care.

One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>---see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC126">export--Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout</A>.  But be aware that doesn't
handle an export containing binary files correctly.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC97">Problems with the <CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE> keyword</A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE> keyword is somewhat
controversial.  As long as you are working on your
development system the information is easily accessible
even if you do not use the <CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE>
keyword--just do a <CODE>cvs log</CODE>.  Once you export
the file the history information might be useless
anyhow.

</P>
<P>
A more serious concern is that CVS is not good at
handling <CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE> entries when a branch is
merged onto the main trunk.  Conflicts often result
from the merging operation.

</P>
<P>
People also tend to "fix" the log entries in the file
(correcting spelling mistakes and maybe even factual
errors).  If that is done the information from
<CODE>cvs log</CODE> will not be consistent with the
information inside the file.  This may or may not be a
problem in real life.

</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the <CODE>&#36;Log$</CODE>
keyword should be inserted <EM>last</EM> in the file, and
not in the files header, if it is to be used at all.
That way the long list of change messages will not

If you modify a program to better fit your site, you
probably want to include your modifications when the next
release of the program arrives.  CVS can help you with
this task.

In the terminology used in CVS, the supplier of the
program is called a <STRONG>vendor</STRONG>.  The unmodified
distribution from the vendor is checked in on its own
branch, the <STRONG>vendor branch</STRONG>.  CVS reserves branch
1.1.1 for this use.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the source and commit it, your revision
will end up on the main trunk.  When a new release is
made by the vendor, you commit it on the vendor branch
and copy the modifications onto the main trunk.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to create and update
the vendor branch.  When you import a new file,
the vendor branch is made the `head' revision, so
anyone that checks out a copy of the file gets that
revision.  When a local modification is committed it is
placed on the main trunk, and made the `head'
revision.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX371"></A>

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to check in the sources
for the first time.  When you use the <CODE>import</CODE>
command to track third-party sources, the <STRONG>vendor
tag</STRONG> and <STRONG>release tags</STRONG> are useful.  The
<STRONG>vendor tag</STRONG> is a symbolic name for the branch
(which is always 1.1.1, unless you use the <SAMP>`-b
<VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag---See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC104">Multiple vendor branches</A>.).  The
<STRONG>release tags</STRONG> are symbolic names for a particular
release, such as <SAMP>`FSF_0_04'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>import</CODE> does <EM>not</EM> change the
directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it
does not set up that directory as a CVS working
directory; if you want to work with the sources import
them first and then check them out into a different
directory (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC5">Getting the source</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX372"></A>
Suppose you have the sources to a program called
<CODE>wdiff</CODE> in a directory <TT>`wdiff-0.04'</TT>,
and are going to make private modifications that you
want to be able to use even when new releases are made
in the future.  You start by importing the source to
your repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd wdiff-0.04
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.04" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_04
</PRE>

<P>
The vendor tag is named <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP> in the above
example, and the only release tag assigned is
<SAMP>`WDIFF_0_04'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC100">Updating a module with the import command</A></H2>

<P>
When a new release of the source arrives, you import it into the
repository with the same <CODE>import</CODE> command that you used to set up
the repository in the first place.  The only difference is that you
specify a different release tag this time.

</P>

<PRE>
$ tar xfz wdiff-0.05.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.05
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.05" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_05
</PRE>

<P>
For files that have not been modified locally, the newly created
revision becomes the head revision.  If you have made local
changes, <CODE>import</CODE> will warn you that you must merge the changes
into the main trunk, and tell you to use <SAMP>`checkout -j'</SAMP> to do so.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jFSF_DIST:yesterday -jFSF_DIST wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will check out the latest revision of
<SAMP>`wdiff'</SAMP>, merging the changes made on the vendor branch <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP>
since yesterday into the working copy.  If any conflicts arise during
the merge they should be resolved in the normal way (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC80">Conflicts example</A>).  Then, the modified files may be committed.

</P>
<P>
Using a date, as suggested above, assumes that you do
not import more than one release of a product per
day. If you do, you can always use something like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jWDIFF_0_04 -jWDIFF_0_05 wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the two above commands are equivalent.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC101">Reverting to the latest vendor release</A></H2>

<P>
You can also revert local changes completely and return
to the latest vendor release by changing the `head'
revision back to the vendor branch on all files.  For
example, if you have a checked-out copy of the sources
in <TT>`~/work.d/wdiff'</TT>, and you want to revert to the
vendor's version for all the files in that directory,
you would type:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ~/work.d/wdiff
$ cvs admin -bWDIFF .
</PRE>

<P>
You must specify the <SAMP>`-bWDIFF'</SAMP> without any space
after the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC114">admin options</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC102">How to handle binary files with cvs import</A></H2>

<P>
Use the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> wrapper option to tell import which
files are binary.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC159">The cvswrappers file</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC103">How to handle keyword substitution with cvs import</A></H2>

<P>
The sources which you are importing may contain
keywords (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>).  For example,
the vendor may use CVS or some other system
which uses similar keyword expansion syntax.  If you
just import the files in the default fashion, then
the keyword expansions supplied by the vendor will
be replaced by keyword expansions supplied by your
own copy of CVS.  It may be more convenient to
maintain the expansions supplied by the vendor, so
that this information can supply information about
the sources that you imported from the vendor.

</P>
<P>
To maintain the keyword expansions supplied by the
vendor, supply the <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP> option to <CODE>cvs
import</CODE> the first time you import the file.
This will turn off keyword expansion
for that file entirely, so if you want to be more
selective you'll have to think about what you want
and use the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option to <CODE>cvs update</CODE> or
<CODE>cvs admin</CODE> as appropriate.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC104">Multiple vendor branches</A></H2>

<P>
All the examples so far assume that there is only one
vendor from which you are getting sources.  In some
situations you might get sources from a variety of
places.  For example, suppose that you are dealing with
a project where many different people and teams are
modifying the software.  There are a variety of ways to
handle this, but in some cases you have a bunch of
source trees lying around and what you want to do more
than anything else is just to all put them in CVS so
that you at least have them in one place.

</P>
<P>
For handling situations in which there may be more than
one vendor, you may specify the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs import</CODE>.  It takes as an argument the vendor
branch to import to.  The default is <SAMP>`-b 1.1.1'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose that there are two teams, the red
team and the blue team, that are sending you sources.
You want to import the red team's efforts to branch
1.1.1 and use the vendor tag RED.  You want to import
the blue team's efforts to branch 1.1.3 and use the
vendor tag BLUE.  So the commands you might use are:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs import dir RED RED_1-0
$ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir BLUE BLUE_1-5
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if your vendor tag does not match your
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option, CVS will not detect this case!  For
example,

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir RED RED_1-0
</PRE>

<P>
Be careful; this kind of mismatch is sure to sow
confusion or worse.  I can't think of a useful purpose
for the ability to specify a mismatch here, but if you
discover such a use, don't.  CVS is likely to make this
an error in some future release.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC105">How your build system interacts with CVS</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>
<A NAME="IDX374"></A>

</P>
<P>
As mentioned in the introduction, CVS does not
contain software for building your software from source
code.  This section describes how various aspects of
your build system might interact with CVS.

</P>
<P>
One common question, especially from people who are
accustomed to RCS, is how to make their build get
an up to date copy of the sources.  The answer to this
with CVS is two-fold.  First of all, since
CVS itself can recurse through directories, there
is no need to modify your <TT>`Makefile'</TT> (or whatever
configuration file your build tool uses) to make sure
each file is up to date.  Instead, just use two
commands, first <CODE>cvs -q update</CODE> and then
<CODE>make</CODE> or whatever the command is to invoke your
build tool.  Secondly, you do not necessarily
<EM>want</EM> to get a copy of a change someone else made
until you have finished your own work.  One suggested
approach is to first update your sources, then
implement, build and
test the change you were thinking of, and then commit
your sources (updating first if necessary).  By
periodically (in between changes, using the approach
just described) updating your entire tree, you ensure
that your sources are sufficiently up to date.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX375"></A>
One common need is to record which versions of which
source files went into a particular build.  This kind
of functionality is sometimes called <STRONG>bill of
materials</STRONG> or something similar.  The best way to do
this with CVS is to use the <CODE>tag</CODE> command to
record which versions went into a given build
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC47">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>).

</P>
<P>
Using CVS in the most straightforward manner
possible, each developer will have a copy of the entire
source tree which is used in a particular build.  If
the source tree is small, or if developers are
geographically dispersed, this is the preferred
solution.  In fact one approach for larger projects is
to break a project down into smaller
separately-compiled subsystems, and arrange a way of
releasing them internally so that each developer need
check out only those subsystems which are they are
actively working on.

</P>
<P>
Another approach is to set up a structure which allows
developers to have their own copies of some files, and
for other files to access source files from a central
location.  Many people have come up with some such a
system using features such as the symbolic link feature
found in many operating systems, or the <CODE>VPATH</CODE>
feature found in many versions of <CODE>make</CODE>.  One build
tool which is designed to help with this kind of thing
is Odin (see
<CODE>ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/distribs/odin</CODE>).

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC106">Special Files</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX376"></A>
<A NAME="IDX377"></A>
<A NAME="IDX378"></A>
<A NAME="IDX379"></A>
<A NAME="IDX380"></A>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>

</P>
<P>
In normal circumstances, CVS works only with regular
files.  Every file in a project is assumed to be
persistent; it must be possible to open, read and close
them; and so on.  CVS also ignores file permissions and
ownerships, leaving such issues to be resolved by the
developer at installation time.  In other words, it is
not possible to "check in" a device into a repository;
if the device file cannot be opened, CVS will refuse to
handle it.  Files also lose their ownerships and
permissions during repository transactions.

</P>
<P>
If the configuration variable <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC173">The CVSROOT/config configuration file</A>) is set in the repository, CVS will
save the following file characteristics in the
repository:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>user and group ownership

<LI>permissions

<LI>major and minor device numbers

<LI>symbolic links

<LI>hard link structure

</UL>

<P>
Using the <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE> option affects the
behavior of CVS in several ways.  First, some of the
new operations supported by CVS are not accessible to
all users.  In particular, file ownership and special
file characteristics may only be changed by the
superuser.  When the <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE>
configuration variable is set, therefore, users will
have to be `root' in order to perform CVS operations.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE> is in use, some CVS
operations (such as <SAMP>`cvs status'</SAMP>) will not
recognize a file's hard link structure, and so will
emit spurious warnings about mismatching hard links.
The reason is that CVS's internal structure does not
make it easy for these operations to collect all the
necessary data about hard links, so they check for file
conflicts with inaccurate data.

</P>
<P>
A more subtle difference is that CVS considers a file
to have changed only if its contents have changed
(specifically, if the modification time of the working
file does not match that of the repository's file).
Therefore, if only the permissions, ownership or hard
linkage have changed, or if a device's major or minor
numbers have changed, CVS will not notice.  In order to
commit such a change to the repository, you must force
the commit with <SAMP>`cvs commit -f'</SAMP>.  This also means
that if a file's permissions have changed and the
repository file is newer than the working copy,
performing <SAMP>`cvs update'</SAMP> will silently change the
permissions on the working copy.

</P>
<P>
Changing hard links in a CVS repository is particularly
delicate.  Suppose that file <TT>`foo'</TT> is linked to
file <TT>`old'</TT>, but is later relinked to file
<TT>`new'</TT>.  You can wind up in the unusual situation
where, although <TT>`foo'</TT>, <TT>`old'</TT> and <TT>`new'</TT>
have all had their underlying link patterns changed,
only <TT>`foo'</TT> and <TT>`new'</TT> have been modified, so
<TT>`old'</TT> is not considered a candidate for checking
in.  It can be very easy to produce inconsistent
results this way.  Therefore, we recommend that when it
is important to save hard links in a repository, the
prudent course of action is to <CODE>touch</CODE> any file
whose linkage or status has changed since the last
checkin.  Indeed, it may be wise to <CODE>touch *</CODE>
before each commit in a directory with complex hard
link structures.

</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that only regular files may
be merged, for reasons that hopefully are obvious.  If
<SAMP>`cvs update'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs checkout -j'</SAMP> attempts to
merge a symbolic link with a regular file, or two
device files for different kinds of devices, CVS will
report a conflict and refuse to perform the merge.  At
the same time, <SAMP>`cvs diff'</SAMP> will not report any
differences between these files, since no meaningful
textual comparisons can be made on files which contain
no text.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>PreservePermissions</CODE> features do not work
with client/server CVS.  Another limitation is
that hard links must be to other files within the same
directory; hard links across directories are not
supported.

The overall format of all CVS commands is:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cvs</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the CVS program.

<DT><CODE>cvs_options</CODE>
<DD>
Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
described below.

<DT><CODE>cvs_command</CODE>
<DD>
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> elicits a
list of available commands, and <SAMP>`cvs -v'</SAMP> displays version
information on CVS itself.

<DT><CODE>command_options</CODE>
<DD>
Options that are specific for the command.

<DT><CODE>command_args</CODE>
<DD>
Arguments to the commands.
</DL>

<P>
There is unfortunately some confusion between
<CODE>cvs_options</CODE> and <CODE>command_options</CODE>.
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, when given as a <CODE>cvs_option</CODE>, only
affects some of the commands.  When it is given as a
<CODE>command_option</CODE> is has a different meaning, and
is accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC109">CVS's exit status</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX386"></A>

</P>
<P>
CVS can indicate to the calling environment whether it
succeeded or failed by setting its <STRONG>exit status</STRONG>.
The exact way of testing the exit status will vary from
one operating system to another.  For example in a unix
shell script the <SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> variable will be 0 if the
last command returned a successful exit status, or
greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.

</P>
<P>
If CVS is successful, it returns a successful status;
if there is an error, it prints an error message and
returns a failure status.  The one exception to this is
the <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> command.  It will return a
successful status if it found no differences, or a
failure status if there were differences or if there
was an error.  Because this behavior provides no good
way to detect errors, in the future it is possible that
<CODE>cvs diff</CODE> will be changed to behave like the
other CVS commands.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC110" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC110">Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
<A NAME="IDX388"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are some <CODE>command_options</CODE> that are used so
often that you might have set up an alias or some other
means to make sure you always specify that option.  One
example (the one that drove the implementation of the
<TT>`.cvsrc'</TT> support, actually) is that many people find the
default output of the <SAMP>`diff'</SAMP> command to be very
hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs
are much easier to understand.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is a way that you can add
default options to <CODE>cvs_commands</CODE> within cvs,
instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

</P>
<P>
The format of the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is simple.  The
file is searched for a line that begins with the same
name as the <CODE>cvs_command</CODE> being executed.  If a
match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and
added to the command arguments <EM>before</EM> any
options from the command line.

</P>
<P>
If a command has two names (e.g., <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>co</CODE>), the official name, not necessarily the one
used on the command line, will be used to match against
the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
<TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
log -N
diff -u
update -P
checkout -P
</PRE>

<P>
the command <SAMP>`cvs checkout foo'</SAMP> would have the
<SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> option added to the arguments, as well as
<SAMP>`cvs co foo'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
With the example file above, the output from <SAMP>`cvs
diff foobar'</SAMP> will be in unidiff format.  <SAMP>`cvs diff
-c foobar'</SAMP> will provide context diffs, as usual.
Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because <CODE>diff</CODE> doesn't have an option
to specify use of the "old" format, so you would need
<SAMP>`cvs -f diff foobar'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
In place of the command name you can use <CODE>cvs</CODE> to
specify global options (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>).  For
example the following line in <TT>`.cvsrc'</TT>

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -z6
</PRE>

<P>
causes CVS to use compression level 6.

</P>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--allow-root=<VAR>rootdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify legal CVSROOT directory.  See
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC30">Setting up the server for password authentication</A>.

<A NAME="IDX392"></A>
<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
Authenticate all communication between the client and
the server.  Only has an effect on the CVS client.
As of this writing, this is only implemented when using
a GSSAPI connection (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC33">Direct connection with GSSAPI</A>).
Authentication prevents certain sorts of attacks
involving hijacking the active TCP connection.
Enabling authentication does not enable encryption.

<A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>bindir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
In CVS 1.9.18 and older, this specified that
RCS programs are in the <VAR>bindir</VAR> directory.
Current versions of CVS do not run RCS
programs; for compatibility this option is accepted,
but it does nothing.

<A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<DT><CODE>-T <VAR>tempdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>tempdir</VAR> as the directory where temporary files are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.

<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
<A NAME="IDX399"></A>
<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR> as the root directory
pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of
the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC9">The Repository</A>.

<A NAME="IDX400"></A>
<A NAME="IDX401"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>editor</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>editor</VAR> to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> and <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE>
environment variables.  For more information, see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC6">Committing your changes</A>.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Do not read the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file.  This
option is most often used because of the
non-orthogonality of the CVS option set.  For
example, the <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> option <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> (turn off
display of tag names) does not have a corresponding
option to turn the display on.  So if you have
<SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> in the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> entry for <SAMP>`log'</SAMP>,
you may need to use <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> to show the tag names.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display usage information about the specified <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>
(but do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify
a command name, <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> displays overall help for
CVS, including a list of other help options.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Do not log the <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP> in the command history (but execute it
anyway).  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC128">history--Show status of files and users</A>, for information on command history.

<A NAME="IDX402"></A>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

Note that CVS will not necessarily produce exactly
the same output as without <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>.  In some cases
the output will be the same, but in other cases
CVS will skip some of the processing that would
have been required to produce the exact same output.

<DT><CODE>-Q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
generate output for serious problems.

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
suppressed.

<A NAME="IDX403"></A>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files read-only.  Same effect
as if the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is set
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).  The default is to

<A NAME="IDX404"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>

Display version and copyright information for CVS.

<A NAME="IDX405"></A>
<A NAME="IDX406"></A>
<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable.
Files are created read-write by default, unless <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> is
set or <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is given.

<A NAME="IDX407"></A>
<DT><CODE>-x</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt all communication between the client and the

of this writing, this is only implemented when using a
GSSAPI connection (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC33">Direct connection with GSSAPI</A>) or a
Kerberos connection (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC34">Direct connection with kerberos</A>).
Enabling encryption implies that message traffic is
also authenticated.  Encryption support is not
available by default; it must be enabled using a
special configure option, <TT>`--enable-encryption'</TT>,
when you build CVS.

<DT><CODE>-z <VAR>gzip-level</VAR></CODE>

<P>
This section describes the <SAMP>`command_options'</SAMP> that
are available across several CVS commands.  These
options are always given to the right of
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>. Not all
commands support all of these options; each option is
only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you
can almost always count on the same behavior of the
option as in other commands.  (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one CVS command to the other).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`history'</SAMP> command is an exception; it supports
many options that conflict even with these standard options.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date_spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX411"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX412"></A>

Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date_spec</VAR>.
<VAR>date_spec</VAR> is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.

The specification is <STRONG>sticky</STRONG> when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working
file using <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, CVS records the date you specified, so that
further updates in the same directory will use the same date
(for more information on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>).

<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.
(The <CODE>history</CODE> command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC129">history options</A>).

<A NAME="IDX413"></A>
<A NAME="IDX414"></A>
A wide variety of date formats are supported by
CVS.  The most standard ones are ISO8601 (from the
International Standards Organization) and the Internet
e-mail standard (specified in RFC822 as amended by
RFC1123).

ISO8601 dates have many variants but a few examples
are:


<PRE>
1972-09-24
1972-09-24 20:05
</PRE>

For more details about ISO8601 dates, see:


<PRE>
http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html
</PRE>

In addition to the dates allowed in Internet e-mail
itself, CVS also allows some of the fields to be
omitted.  For example:


<PRE>
24 Sep 1972 20:05
24 Sep
</PRE>

The date is interpreted as being in the
local timezone, unless a specific timezone is
specified.

These two date formats are preferred.  However,
CVS currently accepts a wide variety of other date
formats.  They are intentionally not documented here in
any detail, and future versions of CVS might not
accept all of them.

One such format is
<CODE><VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>/<VAR>year</VAR></CODE>.  This may
confuse people who are accustomed to having the month
and day in the other order; <SAMP>`1/4/96'</SAMP> is January 4,
not April 1.

Remember to quote the argument to the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag can look like this:


<PRE>
$ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX415"></A>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
When you specify a particular date or tag to CVS commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used).

<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> is available with these commands:
<CODE>annotate</CODE>, <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>remove</CODE>
commands also have a
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, but it has a different behavior for
those commands.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC119">commit options</A>, and
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC62">Removing files</A>.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Alter the default processing of keywords.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>, for the meaning of
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  Your <VAR>kflag</VAR> specification is
<STRONG>sticky</STRONG> when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> commands,
CVS associates your selected <VAR>kflag</VAR> with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option is available with the <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>import</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
recursing through subdirectories.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same
as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -l'</SAMP> option, which you can specify to the
left of a cvs command!

Available with the following commands: <CODE>annotate</CODE>, <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>edit</CODE>, <CODE>editors</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
<CODE>log</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>status</CODE>, <CODE>tag</CODE>, <CODE>unedit</CODE>, <CODE>update</CODE>, <CODE>watch</CODE>,
and <CODE>watchers</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX416"></A>
<A NAME="IDX417"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>message</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>message</VAR> as log information, instead of
invoking an editor.

Available with the following commands: <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout/commit/tag program.  (A program can be
specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules
database (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>); this option bypasses it).

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -n'</SAMP>
option, which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

Available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
and <CODE>rtag</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune empty directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC63">Removing directories</A>.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Process directories recursively.  This is on by default.

Available with the following commands: <CODE>annotate</CODE>, <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>edit</CODE>, <CODE>editors</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>status</CODE>, <CODE>tag</CODE>, <CODE>unedit</CODE>, <CODE>update</CODE>, <CODE>watch</CODE>,
and <CODE>watchers</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>
<A NAME="IDX419"></A>
Use the revision specified by the <VAR>tag</VAR> argument instead of the
default <STRONG>head</STRONG> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE> command, two special tags are
always available: <SAMP>`HEAD'</SAMP> refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and <SAMP>`BASE'</SAMP> refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> to make your own
copy of a file: CVS remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>).  The
tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC47">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>.

Specifying the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> global option along with the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the RCS file
does not contain the specified tag.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -r'</SAMP> option,
which you can specify to the left of a CVS command!

<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>,
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-W</CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can
use this option repeatedly.  The spec can be a file
name pattern of the same type that you can specify in
the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT> file.
Available with the following commands: <CODE>import</CODE>,
and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>oldfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
access list of <VAR>oldfile</VAR> to the access list of the
RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-a<VAR>logins</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
login names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> to the access list of the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-b[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default branch to <VAR>rev</VAR>.  In CVS, you
normally do not manipulate default branches; sticky
tags (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>) are a better way to decide
which branch you want to work on.  There is one reason
to run <CODE>cvs admin -b</CODE>: to revert to the vendor's
version when using vendor branches (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC101">Reverting to the latest vendor release</A>).
There can be no space between <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> and its argument.

<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
<DT><CODE>-c<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Sets the comment leader to <VAR>string</VAR>.  The comment
leader is not used by current versions of CVS or
RCS 5.7.  Therefore, you can almost surely not
worry about it.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>.

<DT><CODE>-e[<VAR>logins</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Erase the login
names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> from the access list of the RCS file.  If
<VAR>logins</VAR> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

<DT><CODE>-I</CODE>
<DD>
Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
terminal.  This option does not work with the
client/server CVS and is likely to disappear in
a future release of CVS.

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS.  This creates and initializes a
new RCS file, without depositing a revision.  With
CVS, add files with the <CODE>cvs add</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC61">Adding files to a directory</A>).

<DT><CODE>-k<VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the default keyword
substitution to <VAR>subst</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>.  Giving an explicit <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>, <CODE>cvs export</CODE>, or <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> overrides this default.

<DT><CODE>-l[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the revision with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch
is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
<VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the
default branch.  There can be no space between
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> and its argument.

This can be used in conjunction with the
<TT>`rcslock.pl'</TT> script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT>
directory of the CVS source distribution to
provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be
editing a given file at a time).  See the comments in
that file for details (and see the <TT>`README'</TT> file
in that directory for disclaimers about the unsupported
nature of contrib).  According to comments in that
file, locking must set to strict (which is the default).

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option above.

<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>rev</VAR>:<VAR>msg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Replace the log message of revision <VAR>rev</VAR> with
<VAR>msg</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-N<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Act like <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, except override any previous
assignment of <VAR>name</VAR>.  For use with magic branches,
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC54">Magic branch numbers</A>.

<DT><CODE>-n<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Associate the symbolic name <VAR>name</VAR> with the branch
or revision <VAR>rev</VAR>.  It is normally better to use
<SAMP>`cvs tag'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs rtag'</SAMP> instead.  Delete the
symbolic name if both <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and <VAR>rev</VAR> are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
<VAR>name</VAR> is already associated with another number.
If <VAR>rev</VAR> is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A <VAR>rev</VAR> consisting of a branch number
followed by a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> with an empty
<VAR>rev</VAR> stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
<SAMP>`cvs admin -n<VAR>name</VAR>:'</SAMP> associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the
current latest revision of all the RCS files;
this contrasts with <SAMP>`cvs admin -n<VAR>name</VAR>:$'</SAMP> which
associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the revision numbers
extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding
working files.

<A NAME="IDX427"></A>
<A NAME="IDX428"></A>
<A NAME="IDX429"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o<VAR>range</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Deletes (<STRONG>outdates</STRONG>) the revisions given by
<VAR>range</VAR>.

Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless
you know <EM>exactly</EM> what you are doing (for example
see the warnings below about how the
<VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR> syntax is confusing).

If you are short on disc this option might help you.
But think twice before using it--there is no way short
of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!
If you delete different revisions than you planned,
either due to carelessness or (heaven forbid) a CVS
bug, there is no opportunity to correct the error
before the revisions are deleted.  It probably would be
a good idea to experiment on a copy of the repository
first.

Specify <VAR>range</VAR> in one of the following ways:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev1</VAR>::<VAR>rev2</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that
CVS only stores the differences associated with going
from rev1 to rev2, not intermediate steps.  For
example, after <SAMP>`-o 1.3::1.5'</SAMP> one can retrieve
revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the differences to get
from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revision 1.4, or the
differences between 1.3 and 1.4.  Other examples:
<SAMP>`-o 1.3::1.4'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-o 1.3::1.3'</SAMP> have no
effect, because there are no intermediate revisions to
remove.

<DT><CODE>::<VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Collapse revisions between the beginning of the branch
containing <VAR>rev</VAR> and <VAR>rev</VAR> itself.  The
branchpoint and <VAR>rev</VAR> are left intact.  For
example, <SAMP>`-o ::1.3.2.6'</SAMP> deletes revision 1.3.2.1,
revision 1.3.2.5, and everything in between, but leaves
1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev</VAR>::</CODE>
<DD>
Collapse revisions between <VAR>rev</VAR> and the end of the
branch containing <VAR>rev</VAR>.  Revision <VAR>rev</VAR> is
left intact but the head revision is deleted.

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Delete the revision <VAR>rev</VAR>.  For example, <SAMP>`-o
1.3'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`-o 1.2::1.4'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Delete the revisions from <VAR>rev1</VAR> to <VAR>rev2</VAR>,
inclusive, on the same branch.  One will not be able to
retrieve <VAR>rev1</VAR> or <VAR>rev2</VAR> or any of the
revisions in between.  For example, the command
<SAMP>`cvs admin -oR_1_01:R_1_02 .'</SAMP> is rarely useful.
It means to delete revisions up to, and including, the
tag R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
<EM>the same</EM> numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!  In most cases you want to
specify <VAR>rev1</VAR>::<VAR>rev2</VAR> instead.

<DT><CODE>:<VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Delete revisions from the beginning of the
branch containing <VAR>rev</VAR> up to and including
<VAR>rev</VAR>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev</VAR>:</CODE>
<DD>
Delete revisions from revision <VAR>rev</VAR>, including
<VAR>rev</VAR> itself, to the end of the branch containing
<VAR>rev</VAR>.
</DL>

None of the revisions to be deleted may have
branches or locks.

If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic
names, and one specifies one of the <SAMP>`::'</SAMP> syntaxes,
then CVS will give an error and not delete any
revisions.  If you really want to delete both the
symbolic names and the revisions, first delete the
symbolic names with <CODE>cvs tag -d</CODE>, then run
<CODE>cvs admin -o</CODE>.  If one specifies the
non-<SAMP>`::'</SAMP> syntaxes, then CVS will delete the
revisions but leave the symbolic names pointing to
nonexistent revisions.  This behavior is preserved for
compatibility with previous versions of CVS, but
because it isn't very useful, in the future it may
change to be like the <SAMP>`::'</SAMP> case.

Due to the way CVS handles branches <VAR>rev</VAR>
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC54">Magic branch numbers</A>, for an explanation.

Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC57">Merging differences between any two revisions</A>).

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

<DT><CODE>-s<VAR>state</VAR>[:<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the state attribute of the
revision <VAR>rev</VAR> to <VAR>state</VAR>.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is a
branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, assume the latest
revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for <VAR>state</VAR>.  A useful set of states is
<SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> (for experimental), <SAMP>`Stab'</SAMP> (for
stable), and <SAMP>`Rel'</SAMP> (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to <SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
<VAR>cvs log</VAR> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC134">log--Print out log information for files</A>), and in the
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Log$ and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>State$ keywords
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>).  Note that CVS
uses the <CODE>dead</CODE> state for its own purposes; to
take a file to or from the <CODE>dead</CODE> state use
commands like <CODE>cvs remove</CODE> and <CODE>cvs add</CODE>, not
<CODE>cvs admin -s</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-t[<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named <VAR>file</VAR> into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.  The <VAR>file</VAR> pathname
may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
output from <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC134">log--Print out log information for files</A>).
There can be no space between <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> and its argument.

If <VAR>file</VAR> is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> by itself.
Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.  Reading from standard input does not work
for client/server CVS and may change in a future
release of CVS.

<DT><CODE>-t-<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <SAMP>`-t<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>. Write descriptive text
from the <VAR>string</VAR> into the RCS file, deleting
the existing text.
There can be no space between <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> and its argument.

<DT><CODE>-U</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option
above.

<DT><CODE>-u[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
See the option <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> above, for a discussion of
using this option with CVS.  Unlock the revision
with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch is given, unlock
the latest revision on that branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock it.
Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock.
This causes a mail message to be sent to the original
locker.  The message contains a commentary solicited
from the breaker.  The commentary is terminated by

There can be no space between <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> and its argument.

<DT><CODE>-V<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
In previous versions of CVS, this option meant to
write an RCS file which would be acceptable to
RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>, but it is now obsolete and
specifying it will produce an error.

<DT><CODE>-x<VAR>suffixes</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
In previous versions of CVS, this was documented
as a way of specifying the names of the RCS
files.  However, CVS has always required that the
RCS files used by CVS end in <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP>, so
this option has never done anything useful.

Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: working directory.
<LI>

Synonyms: co, get
</UL>

<P>
Create or update a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by <VAR>modules</VAR>.  You must execute
<CODE>checkout</CODE> before using most of the other CVS
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>modules</VAR> are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the <SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>.

</P>
<P>
Depending on the modules you specify, <CODE>checkout</CODE> may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>checkout</CODE> is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where <CODE>checkout</CODE> is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
<CODE>checkout</CODE> will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the <SAMP>`-Q'</SAMP> global option).

</P>
<P>
The files created by <CODE>checkout</CODE> are created
read-write, unless the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option to CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>) is specified, the
<CODE>CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is specified
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC83">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

</P>
<P>
Note that running <CODE>checkout</CODE> on a directory that was already
built by a prior <CODE>checkout</CODE> is also permitted.
This is similar to specifying the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option
to the <CODE>update</CODE> command in the sense that new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.
However, <CODE>checkout</CODE> takes a module name whereas
<CODE>update</CODE> takes a directory name.  Also
to use <CODE>checkout</CODE> this way it must be run from the
top level directory (where you originally ran
<CODE>checkout</CODE> from), so before you run
<CODE>checkout</CODE> to update an existing directory, don't
forget to change your directory to the top level
directory.

</P>
<P>

section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r
<VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP> flags.  If no matching revision is found,
retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring
the file).

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Process keywords according to <VAR>kflag</VAR>.  See
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>.
This option is sticky; future updates of
this file in this working directory will use the same
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  The <CODE>status</CODE> command can be viewed
to see the sticky options.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC151">Quick reference to CVS commands</A>, for
more information on the <CODE>status</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout program (as specified
with the <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option in the modules file;
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>).

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune empty directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC68">Moving and renaming directories</A>.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
Pipe files to the standard output.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Checkout directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use revision <VAR>tag</VAR>.  This option is sticky, and implies <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to those, you can use these special command
options with <CODE>checkout</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A</CODE>
<DD>
Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> options.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output,
instead of creating or modifying any files or
directories in your working directory.

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Create a directory called <VAR>dir</VAR> for the working
files, instead of using the module name.  In general,
using this flag is equivalent to using <SAMP>`mkdir
<VAR>dir</VAR>; cd <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP> followed by the checkout
command without the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> flag.

There is an important exception, however.  It is very
convenient when checking out a single item to have the
output appear in a directory that doesn't contain empty
intermediate directories.  In this case <EM>only</EM>,
CVS tries to "shorten" pathnames to avoid those empty
directories.

For example, given a module <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> that contains
the file <SAMP>`bar.c'</SAMP>, the command <SAMP>`cvs co -d dir
foo'</SAMP> will create directory <SAMP>`dir'</SAMP> and place
<SAMP>`bar.c'</SAMP> inside.  Similarly, given a module
<SAMP>`bar'</SAMP> which has subdirectory <SAMP>`baz'</SAMP> wherein
there is a file <SAMP>`quux.c'</SAMP>, the command <SAMP>`cvs -d
dir co bar/baz'</SAMP> will create directory <SAMP>`dir'</SAMP> and
place <SAMP>`quux.c'</SAMP> inside.

Using the <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> flag will defeat this behavior.
Given the same module definitions above, <SAMP>`cvs co
-N -d dir foo'</SAMP> will create directories <SAMP>`dir/foo'</SAMP>
and place <SAMP>`bar.c'</SAMP> inside, while <SAMP>`cvs co -N -d
dir bar/baz'</SAMP> will create directories <SAMP>`dir/bar/baz'</SAMP>
and place <SAMP>`quux.c'</SAMP> inside.

<DT><CODE>-j <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>.

<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful together with <SAMP>`-d <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  With
this option, CVS will not "shorten" module paths
in your working directory when you check out a single
module.  See the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> flag for examples and a
discussion.

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, but include the status of all modules,
and sort it by the status string.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>, for
info about the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option that is used inside the
modules file to set the module status.

</UL>

<P>
Use <CODE>commit</CODE> when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source
repository.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  <CODE>commit</CODE> is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to limit <CODE>commit</CODE> to the
current directory only.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>commit</CODE> verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with <CODE>update</CODE> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC148">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>).
<CODE>commit</CODE> does not call the <CODE>update</CODE> command
for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the
time is right.

</P>
<P>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>, and see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC166">Loginfo</A>)
and placed in the RCS file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
<CODE>log</CODE> command; see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC134">log--Print out log information for files</A>.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the <SAMP>`-m
<VAR>message</VAR>'</SAMP> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation,
or use the <SAMP>`-F <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> option to specify
that the argument file contains the log message.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>revision</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Commit to <VAR>revision</VAR>.  <VAR>revision</VAR> must be
either a branch, or a revision on the main trunk that
is higher than any existing revision number
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC46">Assigning revisions</A>).  You
cannot commit to a specific revision on a branch.
</DL>

<P>
<CODE>commit</CODE> also supports these options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-F <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Read the log message from <VAR>file</VAR>, instead
of invoking an editor.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Note that this is not the standard behavior of
the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option as defined in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC112">Common command options</A>.

Force CVS to commit a new revision even if you haven't
made any changes to the file.  If the current revision
of <VAR>file</VAR> is 1.7, then the following two commands
are equivalent:


<PRE>
$ cvs commit -f <VAR>file</VAR>
$ cvs commit -r 1.8 <VAR>file</VAR>
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option disables recursion (i.e., it
implies <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>).  To force CVS to commit a new
revision for all files in all subdirectories, you must
use <SAMP>`-f -R'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>message</VAR></CODE>

Use <VAR>message</VAR> as the log message, instead of

<H4><A NAME="SEC121" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC121">Committing to a branch</A></H4>

<P>
You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option.  To
create a branch revision, use the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option
of the <CODE>rtag</CODE> or <CODE>tag</CODE> commands (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC146">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>
or see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC144">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>).  Then, either <CODE>checkout</CODE> or
<CODE>update</CODE> can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
<CODE>commit</CODE> changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cd product_module
[[ hack away ]]
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
This works automatically since the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option is
sticky.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC122" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC122">Creating the branch after editing</A></H4>

<P>
Say you have been working on some extremely
experimental software, based on whatever revision you
happened to checkout last week.  If others in your
group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could
commit your change to a new branch.  Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of CVS conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs update -r EXPR1
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>update</CODE> command will make the <SAMP>`-r
EXPR1'</SAMP> option sticky on all files.  Note that your
changes to the files will never be removed by the
<CODE>update</CODE> command.  The <CODE>commit</CODE> will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is sticky.  You could also do like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs commit -r EXPR1
</PRE>

<P>
but then, only those files that were changed by you
will have the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP> sticky flag.  If you hack
away, and commit without specifying the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP>
flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

</P>
<P>
To work with you on the experimental change, others
would simply do

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module

<P>
CVS can keep a history file that tracks each use of the
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>update</CODE>, and <CODE>release</CODE> commands.  You can
use <CODE>history</CODE> to display this information in
various formats.

</P>
<P>
Logging must be enabled by creating the file
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> <CODE>history</CODE> uses <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> in ways that conflict with the
normal use inside CVS (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC112">Common command options</A>).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC129" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC129">history options</A></H3>

<P>
Several options (shown above as <SAMP>`-report'</SAMP>)  control  what
kind of report is generated:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time
the repository was modified).

<DT><CODE>-e</CODE>
<DD>
Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to
specifying <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> with all record types.  Of course,
<SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> will also include record types which are
added in a future version of CVS; if you are
writing a script which can only handle certain record
types, you'll want to specify <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully
use <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> more than once on the command line.)

<DT><CODE>-o</CODE>
<DD>
Report on checked-out modules.

<DT><CODE>-T</CODE>
<DD>
Report on all tags.

<DT><CODE>-x <VAR>type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Extract a particular set of record types <VAR>type</VAR> from the CVS
history.  The types are indicated by single letters,
which you may specify in combination.

Certain commands have a single record type:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>F</CODE>
<DD>
release
<DT><CODE>O</CODE>
<DD>
checkout
<DT><CODE>E</CODE>
<DD>
export
<DT><CODE>T</CODE>
<DD>
rtag
</DL>

One of four record types may result from an update:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>C</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary but collisions were
detected (requiring manual merging).
<DT><CODE>G</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary and it succeeded.
<DT><CODE>U</CODE>
<DD>
A working file was copied from the repository.
<DT><CODE>W</CODE>
<DD>
The working copy of a file was deleted during
update (because it was gone from the repository).
</DL>

One of three record types results from commit:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>A</CODE>
<DD>
A file was added for the first time.
<DT><CODE>M</CODE>
<DD>
A file was modified.
<DT><CODE>R</CODE>
<DD>
A file was removed.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-flags'</SAMP> constrain or expand
the report without requiring option arguments:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
Show data for all users (the default is to show data
only for the user executing <CODE>history</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Show last modification only.

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Show only the records for modifications done from the
same working directory where <CODE>history</CODE> is
executing.
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-options <VAR>args</VAR>'</SAMP> constrain the report
based on an argument:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>str</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data back to a record containing  the  string
<VAR>str</VAR>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
the repository path.

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data since <VAR>date</VAR>.  This is slightly different
from the normal use of <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP>, which
selects the newest revision older than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-p <VAR>repository</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data for a particular source repository  (you
can specify several <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> options on the same command
line).

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records referring to revisions since the revision
or tag named <VAR>rev</VAR> appears in individual RCS
files.  Each RCS file is searched for the revision or
tag.

<DT><CODE>-t <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records since tag <VAR>tag</VAR> was last added to the
history file.  This differs from the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> flag
above in that it reads only the history file, not the
RCS files, and is much faster.

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records for user <VAR>name</VAR>.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC130" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC130">import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>

</P>


<UL>
<LI>

Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...
<LI>

Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
</UL>

<P>
Use <CODE>import</CODE> to incorporate an entire source
distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source
vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can
use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module
from the outside source.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC98">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
a discussion on this subject.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>repository</VAR> argument gives a directory name
(or a path to a directory) under the CVS root directory
for repositories; if the directory did not exist,
import creates it.

</P>
<P>
When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior
import), it will notify you of any files that conflict
in the two branches of development; use <SAMP>`checkout
-j'</SAMP> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.

</P>
<P>
If CVS decides a file should be ignored
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>), it does not import it and prints
<SAMP>`I '</SAMP> followed by the filename (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC132">import output</A>, for a
complete description of the output).

</P>
<P>
If the file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers'</TT> exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC159">The cvswrappers file</A>.

</P>
<P>
The outside source is saved in a first-level
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.

</P>
<P>
At least three arguments are required.
<VAR>repository</VAR> is needed to identify the collection
of source.  <VAR>vendortag</VAR> is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one <VAR>releasetag</VAR> to identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute <CODE>import</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>import</CODE> does <EM>not</EM> change the
directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it
does not set up that directory as a CVS working
directory; if you want to work with the sources import
them first and then check them out into a different
directory (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC5">Getting the source</A>).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC131">import options</A></H3>

See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC104">Multiple vendor branches</A>.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired.  This
setting will apply to all files created during the
import, but not to any files that previously existed in
the repository.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC96">Substitution modes</A>, for a
list of valid <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> settings.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be ignored during
import.  You can use this option repeatedly.  To avoid
ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by
default), specify `-I !'.

<VAR>name</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>.

<DT><CODE>-W <VAR>spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during

<CODE>import</CODE> keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line
for each file, preceded by one character indicating the status of the file:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>U <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally
modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

<DT><CODE>N <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

<DT><CODE>C <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified;
you will have to merge the changes.

<DT><CODE>I <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>

The file is being ignored (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>).

<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
<A NAME="IDX438"></A>
<DT><CODE>L <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is a symbolic link; <CODE>cvs import</CODE> ignores symbolic links.
People periodically suggest that this behavior should
be changed, but if there is a consensus on what it

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>

Print information about revisions with a checkin
date/time in the range given by the
semicolon-separated list of dates.  The date formats
accepted are those accepted by the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option to

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.  (Default
is to run recursively).

<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD>
Do not print the list of tags for this file.  This
option can be very useful when your site uses a lot of
tags, so rather than "more"'ing over 3 pages of tag
information, the log information is presented without
tags at all.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Print only the name of the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-r<VAR>revisions</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print information about revisions given in the

ranges.  The following table explains the available
range formats:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR></CODE>

<DD>
A range of branches means all revisions
on the branches in that range.

<DT><CODE><VAR>branch</VAR>.</CODE>
<DD>
The latest revision in <VAR>branch</VAR>.
</DL>

A bare <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> with no revisions means the latest
revision on the default branch, normally the trunk.

<P>
You can specify (using the standard <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options) any combination of one or two
revisions or dates.  If only one revision or date is
specified, the patch file reflects differences between
that revision or date and the current head revisions in

<P>
Note that if the software release affected is contained
in more than one directory, then it may be necessary to

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>
Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The
summary includes information about files that were
changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to
the standard output device.  This is useful for finding
out, for example, which files have changed between two
dates or revisions.

<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>
A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard

last change to a file was.

<DT><CODE>-u</CODE>
<DD>
Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.
This option is not available if your <CODE>diff</CODE> does not
support the unidiff format.  Remember that old versions
of the <CODE>patch</CODE> program can't handle the unidiff

This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
<SAMP>`cvs checkout'</SAMP>.  Since CVS doesn't lock files, it
isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have

file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC171">The history file</A>) that you've abandoned your
checkout.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP> to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

<P>
You can use this command to assign symbolic tags to
particular, explicitly specified source revisions in
the repository.  <CODE>rtag</CODE> works directly on the
repository contents (and requires no prior checkout).
Use <CODE>tag</CODE> instead (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC146">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>), to base the
selection of revisions on the contents of your
working directory.

If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists,
CVS will complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use
the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option to force the new tag value.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Tag the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r <VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP>
flags.  If no matching revision is found, use the most
recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite an existing tag of the same name on a
different revision.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any tag program that was specified with the
<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> flag inside the <TT>`modules'</TT> file.
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>).

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Tag directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Only tag those files that contain <VAR>tag</VAR>.  This can
be used to rename a tag: tag only the files identified
by the old tag, then delete the old tag, leaving the
new tag on exactly the same files as the old tag.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to the above common options, these options
are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
Use the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> option to have <CODE>rtag</CODE> look in the
<TT>`Attic'</TT> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC15">The attic</A>) for removed files
that contain the specified tag.  The tag is removed from
these files, which makes it convenient to re-use a
symbolic tag as development continues (and files get
removed from the up-coming distribution).

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
Make the tag a branch tag.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the tag instead of creating it.

In general, tags (often the symbolic names of software
distributions) should not be removed, but the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP>
option is available as a means to remove completely
obsolete symbolic names if necessary (as might be the
case for an Alpha release, or if you mistagged a
module).
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC146" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC146">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A></H2>

<LI>

tag [-lR] [-b] [-c] [-d] symbolic_tag [files...]
<LI>

Requires: working directory, repository.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
<LI>

Synonym: freeze
</UL>

<P>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest
repository versions to your working sources.  The tags
are applied immediately to the repository, as with
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, but the versions are supplied implicitly by the
CVS records of your working files' history rather than
applied explicitly.

</P>
<P>
One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the
current sources when the software freeze date of a
project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze
date, only those changed sources that are to be part of
the release need be re-tagged.

</P>
<P>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which
revisions of which files were used in creating a
software distribution.  The <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands allow you to extract an exact
copy of a tagged release at any time in the future,
regardless of whether files have been changed, added,
or removed since the release was tagged.

</P>
<P>
This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag,
or to create a branch.  See the options section below.

</P>
<P>
If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists,
CVS will complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use
the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option to force the new tag value.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>

Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Tag directories recursively.  This is on by default.
</DL>

<P>
Two special options are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
Make the tag a branch tag
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC49">Branching and merging</A>), allowing concurrent, isolated
development.  This is most useful for creating a patch
to a previously released software distribution.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Check that all files which are to be tagged are
unmodified.  This can be used to make sure that you can reconstruct the
current file contents.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete a tag.

If you use <SAMP>`cvs tag -d symbolic_tag'</SAMP>, the symbolic
tag you specify is deleted instead of being added.
Warning: Be very certain of your ground before you
delete a tag; doing this permanently discards some
historical information, which may later turn out to
be valuable.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D date</CODE>
<DD>
Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date</VAR>.
This option is sticky, and implies <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r
<VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP> flags.  If no matching revision is found,
retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring
the file).

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Process keywords according to <VAR>kflag</VAR>.  See
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC92">Keyword substitution</A>.
This option is sticky; future updates of
this file in this working directory will use the same
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  The <CODE>status</CODE> command can be viewed
to see the sticky options.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC151">Quick reference to CVS commands</A>, for
more information on the <CODE>status</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC59">Recursive behavior</A>.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>

</DL>

<P>
These special options are also available with
<CODE>update</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A</CODE>
<DD>
Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> options.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC48">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Create any directories that exist in the repository if
they're missing from the working directory.  Normally,
<CODE>update</CODE> acts only on directories and files that
were already enrolled in your working directory.

This is useful for updating directories that were
created in the repository since the initial checkout;
but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you
deliberately avoided certain directories in the
repository when you created your working directory
(either through use of a module name or by listing
explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the
command line), then updating with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> will create
those directories, which may not be what you want.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Ignore files whose names match <VAR>name</VAR> (in your
working directory) during the update.  You can specify
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> more than once on the command line to specify
several files to ignore.  Use <SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> to avoid
ignoring any files at all.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>, for other
ways to make CVS ignore some files.

<DT><CODE>-W<VAR>spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during
update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

<VAR>spec</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT>
file. See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC159">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<DT><CODE>-j<VAR>revision</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<P>
<CODE>update</CODE> and <CODE>checkout</CODE> keep you informed of
their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded
by one character indicating the status of the file:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>U <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository.  This is done for any file that exists in
the repository but not in your source, and for files
that you haven't changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

<DT><CODE>P <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`U'</SAMP>, but the CVS server sends a patch
instead of an entire file.  These two things accomplish
the same thing.

<DT><CODE>A <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>R <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>M <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

<SAMP>`M'</SAMP> can indicate one of two states for a file
you're working on: either there were no modifications
to the same file in the repository, so that your file
remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications
in the repository as well as in your copy, but they
were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
working directory.

CVS will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran <CODE>update</CODE>) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while <CODE>update</CODE> runs.

<DT><CODE>C <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to <VAR>file</VAR> with changes from the source
repository.  <VAR>file</VAR> (the copy in your working
directory) is now the result of attempting to merge
the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
<TT>`.#<VAR>file</VAR>.<VAR>revision</VAR>'</TT> where <VAR>revision</VAR>
is the revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC80">Conflicts example</A>.
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with <TT>`.#'</TT> if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under VMS, the file name starts with
<TT>`__'</TT> rather than <TT>`.#'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>? <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<VAR>file</VAR> is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for CVS to ignore (see the
description of the <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option, and
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC170">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>).

<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX458"></A>

</P>
<P>
Inside the repository, in the directory
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT>, there are a number of
supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up
properly they can help make life easier.  For a
discussion of how to edit them, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC20">The administrative files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The most important of these files is the <TT>`modules'</TT>
file, which defines the modules inside the repository.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC153" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC153">The modules file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file records your definitions of
names for collections of source code.  CVS will
use these definitions if you use CVS to update the
modules file (use normal commands like <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, etc).

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file may contain blank lines and
comments (lines beginning with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>) as well as
module definitions.  Long lines can be continued on the
next line by specifying a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) as the
last character on the line.

</P>
<P>
There are three basic types of modules: alias modules,
regular modules, and ampersand modules.  The difference
between them is the way that they map files in the
repository to files in the working directory.  In all
of the following examples, the top-level repository
contains a directory called <TT>`first-dir'</TT>, which
contains two files, <TT>`file1'</TT> and <TT>`file2'</TT>, and a
directory <TT>`sdir'</TT>.  <TT>`first-dir/sdir'</TT> contains
a file <TT>`sfile'</TT>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC154" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC154">Alias modules</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX461"></A>
<A NAME="IDX462"></A>

</P>
<P>
Alias modules are the simplest kind of module:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> -a <VAR>aliases</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
This represents the simplest way of defining a module
<VAR>mname</VAR>.  The <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> flags the definition as a
simple alias: CVS will treat any use of <VAR>mname</VAR> (as
a command argument) as if the list of names
<VAR>aliases</VAR> had been specified instead.
<VAR>aliases</VAR> may contain either other module names or
paths.  When you use paths in aliases, <CODE>checkout</CODE>
creates all intermediate directories in the working
directory, just as if the path had been specified
explicitly in the CVS arguments.
</DL>

<P>
For example, if the modules file contains:

</P>

<PRE>
amodule -a first-dir
</PRE>

<P>
then the following two commands are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs co amodule
$ cvs co first-dir
</PRE>

<P>
and they each would provide output such as:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
U first-dir/file1
U first-dir/file2
cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
U first-dir/sdir/sfile
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC155" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC155">Regular modules</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX463"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> [ options ] <VAR>dir</VAR> [ <VAR>files</VAR>... ]</CODE>
<DD>
In the simplest case, this form of module definition
reduces to <SAMP>`<VAR>mname</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This defines
all the files in directory <VAR>dir</VAR> as module mname.
<VAR>dir</VAR> is a relative path (from <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>) to a
directory of source in the source repository.  In this
case, on checkout, a single directory called
<VAR>mname</VAR> is created as a working directory; no
intermediate directory levels are used by default, even
if <VAR>dir</VAR> was a path involving several directory
levels.
</DL>

<P>
For example, if a module is defined by:

</P>

<PRE>
regmodule first-dir
</PRE>

<P>
then regmodule will contain the files from first-dir:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs co regmodule
cvs checkout: Updating regmodule
U regmodule/file1
U regmodule/file2
cvs checkout: Updating regmodule/sdir
U regmodule/sdir/sfile
$
</PRE>

<P>
By explicitly specifying files in the module definition
after <VAR>dir</VAR>, you can select particular files from
directory <VAR>dir</VAR>.  Here is
an example:

</P>

<PRE>
regfiles first-dir/sdir sfile
</PRE>

<P>
With this definition, getting the regfiles module
will create a single working directory
<TT>`regfiles'</TT> containing the file listed, which
comes from a directory deeper
in the CVS source repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs co regfiles
U regfiles/sfile
$
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC156" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC156">Ampersand modules</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX464"></A>
<A NAME="IDX465"></A>

</P>
<P>
A module definition can refer to other modules by
including <SAMP>`&#38;<VAR>module</VAR>'</SAMP> in its definition.

<PRE>
<VAR>mname</VAR> [ options ] <VAR>&#38;module</VAR>...
</PRE>

<P>
Then getting the module creates a subdirectory for each such
module, in the directory containing the module.  For
example, if modules contains

</P>

<PRE>
ampermod &#38;first-dir
</PRE>

<P>
then a checkout will create an <CODE>ampermod</CODE> directory
which contains a directory called <CODE>first-dir</CODE>,
which in turns contains all the directories and files
which live there.  For example, the command

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs co ampermod
</PRE>

<P>
will create the following files:

</P>

<PRE>
ampermod/first-dir/file1
ampermod/first-dir/file2
ampermod/first-dir/sdir/sfile
</PRE>

<P>
There is one quirk/bug: the messages that CVS
prints omit the <TT>`ampermod'</TT>, and thus do not
correctly display the location to which it is checking
out the files:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs co ampermod
cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
U first-dir/file1
U first-dir/file2
cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
U first-dir/sdir/sfile
$
</PRE>

<P>
Do not rely on this buggy behavior; it may get fixed in
a future release of CVS.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC157" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC157">Excluding directories</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX466"></A>
<A NAME="IDX467"></A>

</P>
<P>
An alias module may exclude particular directories from
other modules by using an exclamation mark (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP>)
before the name of each directory to be excluded.

</P>
<P>
For example, if the modules file contains:

</P>

<PRE>
exmodule -a !first-dir/sdir first-dir
</PRE>

<P>
then checking out the module <SAMP>`exmodule'</SAMP> will check
out everything in <SAMP>`first-dir'</SAMP> except any files in
the subdirectory <SAMP>`first-dir/sdir'</SAMP>.

<DL COMPACT>

argument, the full pathname of the affected directory
in a source repository.  The <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>,

ways to call a program on commit.

<A NAME="IDX474"></A>

Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is
printed with <SAMP>`cvs checkout -s'</SAMP> the modules are
sorted according to primarily module status, and
secondarily according to the module name.  This option
has no other meaning.  You can use this option for

<H2><A NAME="SEC159" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC159">The cvswrappers file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX483"></A>

<A NAME="IDX485"></A>

</P>

<P>
Wrappers allow you to set a hook which transforms files on
their way in and out of CVS.

</P>
<P>
The file <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> defines the script that will be
run on a file when its name matches a regular
expresion. There are two scripts that can be run on a
file or directory. One script is executed on the file/directory
before being checked into the repository (this is denoted
with the <CODE>-t</CODE> flag) and the other when the file is
checked out of the repository (this is denoted with the
<CODE>-f</CODE> flag).  The <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> feature does
not work with client/server CVS.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> also has a <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option to
specify the merge methodology that should be used when
a non-binary file is updated.  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> means the usual
CVS behavior: try to merge the files.  <CODE>COPY</CODE>
means that <CODE>cvs update</CODE> will refuse to merge
files, as it also does for files specified as binary
with <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> (but if the file is specified as
binary, there is no need to specify <SAMP>`-m 'COPY''</SAMP>).
CVS will provide the user with the
two versions of the files, and require the user using
mechanisms outside CVS, to insert any necessary
changes.  <STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>: do not use <CODE>COPY</CODE> with
CVS 1.9 or earlier--such versions of CVS will
copy one version of your file over the other, wiping
out the previous contents.
The <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> wrapper option only affects behavior when
merging is done on update; it does not affect how files
are stored.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC74">Handling binary files</A>, for more on
binary files.

</P>
<P>
The basic format of the file <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> is:

</P>

<PRE>
wildcard     [option value][option value]...

where option is one of
-f           from cvs filter         value: path to filter
-t           to cvs filter           value: path to filter
-m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
-k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode

and value is a single-quote delimited value.
</PRE>


<PRE>
*.nib    -f 'unwrap %s' -t 'wrap %s %s' -m 'COPY'
*.c      -t 'indent %s %s'
</PRE>

<P>
The above example of a <TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> file
states that all files/directories that end with a <CODE>.nib</CODE>
should be filtered with the <TT>`wrap'</TT> program before
checking the file into the repository. The file should
be filtered though the <TT>`unwrap'</TT> program when the
file is checked out of the repository. The
<TT>`cvswrappers'</TT> file also states that a <CODE>COPY</CODE>
methodology should be used when updating the files in
the repository (that is, no merging should be performed).

</P>
<P>
The last example line says that all files that end with
<CODE>.c</CODE> should be filtered with <TT>`indent'</TT>
before being checked into the repository. Unlike the previous
example, no filtering of the <CODE>.c</CODE> file is done when
it is checked out of the repository.
The <CODE>-t</CODE> filter is called with two arguments,
the first is the name of the file/directory to filter
and the second is the pathname to where the resulting
filtered file should be placed.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-f</CODE> filter is called with one argument,
which is the name of the file to filter from. The end
result of this filter will be a file in the user's directory
that they can work on as they normally would.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> features do not
conveniently handle one portion of CVS's operation:
determining when files are modified.  CVS will still
want a file (or directory) to exist, and it will use
its modification time to determine whether a file is
modified.  If CVS erroneously thinks a file is
unmodified (for example, a directory is unchanged but
one of the files within it is changed), you can force
it to check in the file anyway by specifying the
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option to <CODE>cvs commit</CODE> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC119">commit options</A>).

</P>
<P>
For another example, the following command imports a
directory, treating files whose name ends in
<SAMP>`.exe'</SAMP> as binary:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> flag in the <TT>`modules'</TT> file can be
used to run a certain program whenever files are
committed (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>).  The files described in
this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

</P>
<P>
There are three kind of programs that can be run on
commit.  They are specified in files in the repository,
as described below.  The following table summarizes the
file names and the purpose of the corresponding
programs.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`commitinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The program is responsible for checking that the commit
is allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status
the commit will be aborted.

<DT><TT>`verifymsg'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is used to evaluate the log message,
and possibly verify that it contains all required
fields.  This is most useful in combination with the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can hold a log message
template (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC169">Rcsinfo</A>).

<DT><TT>`editinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is used to edit the log message,
and possibly verify that it contains all required
fields.  This is most useful in combination with the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can hold a log message
template (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC169">Rcsinfo</A>).  (obsolete)

<DT><TT>`loginfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is called when the commit is
complete.  It receives the log message and some
additional information and can store the log message in
a file, or mail it to appropriate persons, or maybe
post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
imagination is the limit!

here.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX490"></A>
Each line contains the following:

<UL>
<LI>

A regular expression.  This is a basic regular
expression in the syntax used by GNU emacs.

<LI>

A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

<LI>

A file name or command-line template.
</UL>

<P>
Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the
character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are treated as comments.  Long lines
unfortunately can <EM>not</EM> be broken in two parts in
any way.

</P>
<P>
The first regular expression that matches the current
directory name in the repository is used.  The rest of the line
is used as a file name or command-line as appropriate.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC162" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC162">Commitinfo</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`commitinfo'</TT> file defines programs to execute
whenever <SAMP>`cvs commit'</SAMP> is about to execute.  These
programs are used for pre-commit checking to verify
that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for
instance, to verify that the changed files conform to
to your site's standards for coding practice.

</P>
<P>
As mentioned earlier, each line in the
<TT>`commitinfo'</TT> file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template can include
a program name and any number of arguments you wish to
supply to it.  The full path to the current source
repository is appended to the template, followed by the
file names of any files involved in the commit (added,
removed, and modified files).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
The first line with a regular expression matching the
relative path to the module will be used.  If the
command returns a non-zero exit status the commit will
be aborted.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or the name <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
<TT>`commitinfo'</TT> will be run on the <EM>remote</EM>
(i.e., server) side, not the client side (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC26">Remote repositories</A>).

</P>
<P>
Once you have entered a log message, you can evaluate
that message to check for specific content, such as
a bug ID.  Use the <TT>`verifymsg'</TT> file to
specify a program that is used to verify the log message.
This program could be a simple script that checks
that the entered message contains the required fields.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`verifymsg'</TT> file is often most useful together
with the <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can be used to
specify a log message template.

</P>
<P>
Each line in the <TT>`verifymsg'</TT> file consists of a
regular expression and a command-line template.  The
template must include a program name, and can include
any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

</P>
<P>
One thing that should be noted is that the <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP>
keyword is not supported.  If more than one matching
line is found, the first one is used.  This can be
useful for specifying a default verification script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
If the verification script exits with a non-zero exit status,
the commit is aborted.

</P>
<P>
Note that the verification script cannot change the log
message; it can merely accept it or reject it.

</P>
<P>
The following is a little silly example of a
<TT>`verifymsg'</TT> file, together with the corresponding
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, the log message template and an
verification  script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first
line of the log message.  The rest of log message is
free text.  The following template is found in the file
<TT>`/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>NOTE:</EM> The <TT>`editinfo'</TT> feature has been
rendered obsolete.  To set a default editor for log
messages use the <CODE>EDITOR</CODE> environment variable
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>) or the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> global
option (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>).  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC163">Verifying log messages</A>,
for information on the use of the <TT>`verifymsg'</TT>
feature for evaluating log messages.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make sure that all log messages look the
same way, you can use the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file to
specify a program that is used to edit the log message.
This program could be a custom-made editor that always
enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a
simple shell script that calls an editor, and checks
that the entered message contains the required fields.

</P>
<P>
If no matching line is found in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT>
file, the editor specified in the environment variable
<CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> is used instead.  If that variable is
not set, then the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE>
is used instead.  If that variable is not
set a default will be used.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC6">Committing your changes</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file is often most useful together
with the <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can be used to
specify a log message template.

</P>
<P>
Each line in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file consists of a
regular expression and a command-line template.  The
template must include a program name, and can include
any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

</P>
<P>
One thing that should be noted is that the <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP>
keyword is not supported.  If more than one matching
line is found, the first one is used.  This can be
useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status,
the commit is aborted.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
or when the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> options to <CODE>cvs
commit</CODE> are used, <TT>`editinfo'</TT> will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this; use
<TT>`verifymsg'</TT> instead.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC165" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC165">Editinfo example</A></H3>

<P>
The following is a little silly example of a
<TT>`editinfo'</TT> file, together with the corresponding
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, the log message template and an
editor script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first
line of the log message.  The rest of log message is
free text.  The following template is found in the file
<TT>`/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>
BugId:
</PRE>

<P>
The script <TT>`/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit'</TT> is used to
edit the log message.

</P>

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file is used to control where
<SAMP>`cvs commit'</SAMP> log information is sent.  The first
entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>.  If a match is found, then
the remainder of the line is a filter program that
should expect log information on its standard input.

</P>
<P>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The first matching regular expression is used.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC160">The commit support files</A>, for a description of the syntax of
the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
The user may specify a format string as
part of the filter.  The string is composed of a
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a space, or followed by a single
format character, or followed by a set of format
characters surrounded by <SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP> as
separators.  The format characters are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>s</TT>
<DD>
file name
<DT><TT>V</TT>
<DD>
old version number (pre-checkin)
<DT><TT>v</TT>
<DD>
new version number (post-checkin)
</DL>

<P>
All other characters that appear in a format string
expand to an empty field (commas separating fields are
still provided).

</P>
<P>
For example, some valid format strings are <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`%s'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%{s}'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`%{sVv}'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The output will be a string of tokens separated by
spaces.  For backwards compatibility, the first
token will be the repository name.  The rest of the
tokens will be comma-delimited lists of the information
requested in the format string.  For example, if
<SAMP>`/u/src/master'</SAMP> is the repository, <SAMP>`%{sVv}'</SAMP>
is the format string, and three files (<TT>ChangeLog</TT>,
<TT>Makefile</TT>, <TT>foo.c</TT>) were modified, the output
might be:

</P>

<PRE>
/u/src/master ChangeLog,1.1,1.2 Makefile,1.3,1.4 foo.c,1.12,1.13
</PRE>

<P>
As another example, <SAMP>`%{}'</SAMP> means that only the
name of the repository will be generated.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT> will be run on the <EM>remote</EM>
(i.e., server) side, not the client side (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC26">Remote repositories</A>).

</P>

<P>
The following <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file, together with the
tiny shell-script below, appends all log messages
to the file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog'</TT>,
and any commits to the administrative files (inside
the <TT>`CVSROOT'</TT> directory) are also logged in
<TT>`/usr/adm/cvsroot-log'</TT>.

It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which
contains files which correspond to the latest version
in the repository.  For example, other developers might
want to refer to the latest sources without having to
check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site
with CVS and want every checkin to cause the files
used by the web server to be updated.

</P>
<P>
The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  Doing so in the naive way will
cause a problem with locks, so the <CODE>cvs update</CODE>
must be run in the background.
Here is an example for unix (this should all be on one line):

</P>

<PRE>
^cyclic-pages           (date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
 cvs -q update -d) &#38;) &#62;&#62; $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2&#62;&#38;1
</PRE>

<P>
This will cause checkins to repository directories
starting with <CODE>cyclic-pages</CODE> to update the checked
out tree in <TT>`/u/www/local-docs'</TT>.

<P>
The <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file can be used to specify a form to
edit when filling out the commit log.  The
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file has a syntax similar to the
<TT>`verifymsg'</TT>, <TT>`commitinfo'</TT> and <TT>`loginfo'</TT>
files.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC161">The common syntax</A>.  Unlike the other files the second
part is <EM>not</EM> a command-line template.  Instead,
the part after the regular expression should be a full pathname to
a file containing the log message template.

</P>
<P>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The log message template will be used as a default log
message.  If you specify a log message with <SAMP>`cvs
commit -m <VAR>message</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs commit -f
<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> that log message will override the
template.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC163">Verifying log messages</A>, for an example <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT>
file.

</P>
<P>
When CVS is accessing a remote repository,
the contents of <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> at the time a directory
is first checked out will specify a template which does
not then change.  If you edit <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> or its
templates, you may need to check out a new working
directory.

</P>
<P>
There are certain file names that frequently occur
inside your working copy, but that you don't want to
put under CVS control.  Examples are all the object
files that you get while you compile your sources.
Normally, when you run <SAMP>`cvs update'</SAMP>, it prints a
line for each file it encounters that it doesn't know
about (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC150">update output</A>).

</P>
<P>
CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns)
that it should ignore while running <CODE>update</CODE>,
<CODE>import</CODE> and <CODE>release</CODE>.
This list is constructed in the following way.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The list is initialized to include certain file name
patterns: names associated with CVS
administration, or with other common source control
systems; common names for patch files, object files,
archive files, and editor backup files; and other names
that are usually artifacts of assorted utilities.
Currently, the default list of ignored file name
patterns is:

<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>

<PRE>
    RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
    RCSLOG  cvslog.*
    tags    TAGS
    .make.state     .nse_depinfo
    *~      #*      .#*     ,*      _$*     *$
    *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
    *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
    *.Z     *.elc   *.ln
    core
</PRE>

<LI>

The per-repository list in
<TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore'</TT> is appended to
the list, if that file exists.

<LI>

The per-user list in <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> in your home
directory is appended to the list, if it exists.

<LI>

Any entries in the environment variable
<CODE>$CVSIGNORE</CODE> is appended to the list.

<LI>

Any <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options given to CVS is appended.

<LI>

As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents
of any <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> will be appended to the list.
The patterns found in <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> are only valid
for the directory that contains them, not for
any sub-directories.
</UL>

<P>
In any of the 5 places listed above, a single
exclamation mark (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP>) clears the ignore list.
This can be used if you want to store any file which
normally is ignored by CVS.

</P>
<P>
Specifying <SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> to <CODE>cvs import</CODE> will import
everything, which is generally what you want to do if
you are importing files from a pristine distribution or
any other source which is known to not contain any
extraneous files.  However, looking at the rules above
you will see there is a fly in the ointment; if the
distribution contains any <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> files, then
the patterns from those files will be processed even if
<SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> is specified.  The only workaround is to
remove the <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> files in order to do the
import.  Because this is awkward, in the future
<SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> might be modified to override
<TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> files in each directory.

</P>
<P>
Note that the syntax of the ignore files consists of a
series of lines, each of which contains a space
separated list of filenames.  This offers no clean way
to specify filenames which contain spaces, but you can
use a workaround like <TT>`foo?bar'</TT> to match a file
named <TT>`foo bar'</TT> (it also matches <TT>`fooxbar'</TT>
and the like).  Also note that there is currently no
way to specify comments.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC171" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC171">The history file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>

</P>
<P>
The file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'</TT> is used
to log information for the <CODE>history</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC128">history--Show status of files and users</A>).  This file must be created to turn
on logging.  This is done automatically if the
<CODE>cvs init</CODE> command is used to set up the
repository (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC23">Creating a repository</A>).

</P>
<P>
The file format of the <TT>`history'</TT> file is
documented only in comments in the CVS source
code, but generally programs should use the <CODE>cvs
history</CODE> command to access it anyway, in case the
format changes with future releases of CVS.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC172" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC172">Expansions in administrative files</A></H2>

<P>
Sometimes in writing an administrative file, you might
want the file to be able to know various things based
on environment CVS is running in.  There are
several mechanisms to do that.

</P>
<P>
To find the home directory of the user running CVS
(from the <CODE>HOME</CODE> environment variable), use
<SAMP>`~'</SAMP> followed by <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> or the end of the line.
Likewise for the home directory of <VAR>user</VAR>, use
<SAMP>`~<VAR>user</VAR>'</SAMP>.  These variables are expanded on
the server machine, and don't get any reasonable
expansion if pserver (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC29">Direct connection with password authentication</A>)
is in use; therefore user variables (see below) may be
a better choice to customize behavior based on the user
running CVS.

</P>
<P>
One may want to know about various pieces of
information internal to CVS.  A CVS internal
variable has the syntax <CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>,
where <VAR>variable</VAR> starts with a letter and consists
of alphanumberic characters and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  If the
character following <VAR>variable</VAR> is a
non-alphanumeric character other than <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, the
<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP> can be omitted.  The CVS
internal variables are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CVSROOT</CODE>
<DD>
This is the value of the CVS root in use.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC9">The Repository</A>, for a description of the various
ways to specify this.

<DT><CODE>RCSBIN</CODE>
<DD>
In CVS 1.9.18 and older, this specified the
directory where CVS was looking for RCS
programs.  Because CVS no longer runs RCS
programs, specifying this internal variable is now an
error.

<DT><CODE>CVSEDITOR</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>VISUAL</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>EDITOR</CODE>
<DD>
These all expand to the same value, which is the editor
that CVS is using.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>, for how
to specify this.

<DT><CODE>USER</CODE>
<DD>
Username of the user running CVS (on the CVS
server machine).
</DL>

<P>
If you want to pass a value to the administrative files
which the user who is running CVS can specify,
use a user variable.  To expand a user variable, the
administrative file contains
<CODE>${=<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>.  To set a user variable,
specify the global option <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> to CVS, with
argument <CODE><VAR>variable</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>.  It may be
particularly useful to specify this option via
<TT>`.cvsrc'</TT> (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC110">Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</A>).

</P>
<P>
For example, if you want the administrative file to
refer to a test directory you might create a user
variable <CODE>TESTDIR</CODE>.  Then if CVS is invoked
as

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -s TESTDIR=/work/local/tests
</PRE>

<P>
and the
administrative file contains <CODE>sh
${=TESTDIR}/runtests</CODE>, then that string is expanded
to <CODE>sh /work/local/tests/runtests</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All other strings containing <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> are reserved;
there is no way to quote a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> character so that
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> represents itself.

</P>

</P>
<P>
The administrative file <TT>`config'</TT> contains various
miscellaneous settings which affect the behavior of
CVS.  The syntax is slightly different from the
other administrative files.  Variables are not
expanded.  Lines which start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are
considered comments.
Other lines consist of a keyword, <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, and a
value.  Note that this syntax is very strict.
Extraneous spaces or tabs are not permitted.

</P>
<P>
Currently defined keywords are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>RCSBIN=<VAR>bindir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>

For CVS 1.9.12 through 1.9.18, this setting told
CVS to look for RCS programs in the
<VAR>bindir</VAR> directory.  Current versions of CVS
do not run RCS programs; for compatibility this
setting is accepted, but it does nothing.

<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<DT><CODE>SystemAuth=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>value</VAR> is <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP>, then pserver should check
for users in the system's user database if not found in
<TT>`CVSROOT/passwd'</TT>.  If it is <SAMP>`no'</SAMP>, then all
pserver users must exist in <TT>`CVSROOT/passwd'</TT>.
The default is <SAMP>`yes'</SAMP>.  For more on pserver, see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC29">Direct connection with password authentication</A>.

<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<DT><CODE>PreservePermissions=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Enable support for saving special device files,
symbolic links, file permissions and ownerships in the
repository.  The default value is <SAMP>`no'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC106">Special Files</A> for the full implications of using
this keyword.

<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
<DT><CODE>TopLevelAdmin=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Modify the <SAMP>`checkout'</SAMP> command to create a
<SAMP>`CVS'</SAMP> directory at the top level of the new
working directory, in addition to <SAMP>`CVS'</SAMP>
directories created within checked-out directories.
The default value is <SAMP>`no'</SAMP>.

This option is useful if you find yourself performing
many commands at the top level of your working
directory, rather than in one of the checked out
subdirectories.  The <SAMP>`CVS'</SAMP> directory created there
will mean you don't have to specify <SAMP>`CVSROOT'</SAMP> for
each command.  It also provides a place for the
<SAMP>`CVS/Template'</SAMP> file (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC19">How data is stored in the working directory</A>).

If this is set, <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE> will
try hard to make the files in your working directory
read-only.  When this is not set, the default behavior
is to permit modification of your working files.

<DT><CODE>$CVSUMASK</CODE>
<DD>
Controls permissions of files in the repository.  See
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC13">File permissions</A>.

<DT><CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>
<DD>
Should contain the full pathname to the root of the CVS
source repository (where the RCS files are
kept).  This information must be available to CVS for
most commands to execute; if <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> is not set,
or if you wish to override it for one invocation, you
can supply it on the command line: <SAMP>`cvs -d cvsroot
cvs_command...'</SAMP> Once you have checked out a working
directory, CVS stores the appropriate root (in
the file <TT>`CVS/Root'</TT>), so normally you only need to
worry about this when initially checking out a working
directory.

<DT><CODE>$EDITOR</CODE>

file, and other such files, are searched.  On Unix, CVS
just checks for HOME.  On Windows NT, the system will
set HOMEDRIVE, for example to <SAMP>`d:'</SAMP> and HOMEPATH,
for example to <TT>`\joe'</TT>.  On Windows 95, you'll
probably need to set HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH yourself.

<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_RSH</CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the external program which CVS connects with,
when <CODE>:ext:</CODE> access method is specified.
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC28">Connecting with rsh</A>.

<DT><CODE>$CVS_SERVER</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode when accessing a remote
repository using RSH.  It specifies the name of
the program to start on the server side when accessing
a remote repository using RSH.  The default value
is <CODE>cvs</CODE>.  see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC28">Connecting with rsh</A>

<DT><CODE>$CVS_PASSFILE</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode when accessing the <CODE>cvs
login server</CODE>.  Default value is <TT>`$HOME/.cvspass'</TT>.
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC31">Using the client with password authentication</A>

<DT><CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_PORT</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode when accessing the server
via Kerberos.
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC34">Direct connection with kerberos</A>

<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_RCMD_PORT</CODE>
<DD>
Used in client-server mode.  If set, specifies the port
number to be used when accessing the RCMD demon on
the server side. (Currently not used for Unix clients).

<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>
<DD>
Used for debugging only in client-server
mode.  If set, everything send to the server is logged
into <TT>`<CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>.in'</TT> and everything
send from the server is logged into
<TT>`<CODE>$CVS_CLIENT_LOG</CODE>.out'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_SERVER_SLEEP</CODE>
<DD>
Used only for debugging the server side in
client-server mode.  If set, delays the start of the
server child process the specified amount of
seconds so that you can attach to it with a debugger.

<A NAME="IDX545"></A>
<DT><CODE>$CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT</CODE>
<DD>
(What is the purpose of this variable?)

<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
<DT><CODE>$COMSPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Used under OS/2 only.  It specifies the name of the
command interpreter and defaults to CMD.EXE.

<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TMP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<DT><CODE>$TEMP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
Directory in which temporary files are located.
The CVS server uses
<CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC111">Global options</A>, for a
description of how to specify this.
Some parts of CVS will always use <TT>`/tmp'</TT> (via
the <CODE>tmpnam</CODE> function provided by the system).

On Windows NT, <CODE>TMP</CODE> is used (via the <CODE>_tempnam</CODE>
function provided by the system).

The <CODE>patch</CODE> program which is used by the CVS
client uses <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>, and if it is not set, uses
<TT>`/tmp'</TT> (at least with GNU patch 2.1).  Note that
if your server and client are both running CVS
1.9.10 or later, CVS will not invoke an external
<CODE>patch</CODE> program.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
The repository format is compatible going back to
CVS 1.3.  But see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC88">Using watches with old versions of CVS</A>, if
you have copies of CVS 1.6 or older and you want
to use the optional developer communication features.

</P>
<P>
The working directory format is compatible going back
to CVS 1.5.  It did change between CVS 1.3
and CVS 1.5.  If you run CVS 1.5 or newer on
a working directory checked out with CVS 1.3,
CVS will convert it, but to go back to CVS
1.3 you need to check out a new working directory with
CVS 1.3.

</P>
<P>
The remote protocol is interoperable going back to CVS 1.5, but no
further (1.5 was the first official release with the remote protocol,
but some older versions might still be floating around).  In many
cases you need to upgrade both the client and the server to take
advantage of new features and bugfixes, however.

If you are having trouble with CVS, this appendix
may help.  If there is a particular error message which
you are seeing, then you can look up the message
alphabetically.  If not, you can look through the
section on other problems to see if your problem is
mentioned there.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC177" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC177">Partial list of error messages</A></H2>

<P>
Here is a partial list of error messages that you may
see from CVS.  It is not a complete list---CVS
is capable of printing many, many error messages, often
with parts of them supplied by the operating system,
but the intention is to list the common and/or
potentially confusing error messages.

</P>
<P>
The messages are alphabetical, but introductory text
such as <SAMP>`cvs update: '</SAMP> is not considered in
ordering them.

</P>
<P>
In some cases the list includes messages printed by old
versions of CVS (partly because users may not be
sure which version of CVS they are using at any
particular moment).

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cvs <VAR>command</VAR>: authorization failed: server <VAR>host</VAR> rejected access</CODE>
<DD>
This is a generic response when trying to connect to a
pserver server which chooses not to provide a
specific reason for denying authorization.  Check that
the username and password specified are correct and
that the CVSROOT specified is allowed by --allow-root
in inetd.conf.  See section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC29">Direct connection with password authentication</A>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>:<VAR>line</VAR>: Assertion '<VAR>text</VAR>' failed</CODE>
<DD>
The exact format of this message may vary depending on
your system.  It indicates a bug in CVS, which can
be handled as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>.

<DT><CODE>cvs <VAR>command</VAR>: conflict: removed <VAR>file</VAR> was modified by second party</CODE>
<DD>
This message indicates that you removed a file, and
someone else modified it.  To resolve the conflict,
first run <SAMP>`cvs add <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>.  If desired, look
at the other party's modification to decide whether you
still want to remove it.  If you don't want to remove
it, stop here.  If you do want to remove it, proceed
with <SAMP>`cvs remove <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> and commit your
removal.

<DT><CODE>cannot change permissions on temporary directory</CODE>
<DD>

<PRE>
Operation not permitted
</PRE>

This message has been happening in a non-reproducible,
occasional way when we run the client/server testsuite,
both on Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 and 4.1.  We haven't been
able to figure out what causes it, nor is it known
whether it is specific to linux (or even to this
particular machine!).  If the problem does occur on
other unices, <SAMP>`Operation not permitted'</SAMP> would be
likely to read <SAMP>`Not owner'</SAMP> or whatever the system
in question uses for the unix <CODE>EPERM</CODE> error.  If
you have any information to add, please let us know as
described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>.  If you experience this error
while using CVS, retrying the operation which
produced it should work fine.

<DT><CODE>cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory</CODE>
<DD>
This generally indicates a CVS internal error, and
can be handled as with other CVS bugs
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>).  Usually there is a workaround--the
exact nature of which would depend on the situation but
which hopefully could be figured out.

<DT><CODE>cvs [init aborted]: cannot open CVS/Root: No such file or directory</CODE>
<DD>
This message is harmless.  Provided it is not
accompanied by other errors, the operation has
completed successfully.  This message should not occur
with current versions of CVS, but it is documented
here for the benefit of CVS 1.9 and older.

<DT><CODE>cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file <VAR>file</VAR> to CVS/,,<VAR>file</VAR>: Invalid argument</CODE>
<DD>
This message has been reported as intermittently
happening with CVS 1.9 on Solaris 2.5.  The cause is
unknown; if you know more about what causes it, let us
know as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>.

<DT><CODE>cvs [<VAR>command</VAR> aborted]: cannot start server via rcmd</CODE>
<DD>
This, unfortunately, is a rather nonspecific error
message which CVS 1.9 will print if you are
running the CVS client and it is having trouble
connecting to the server.  Current versions of CVS
should print a much more specific error message.  If
you get this message when you didn't mean to run the
client at all, you probably forgot to specify
<CODE>:local:</CODE>, as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC9">The Repository</A>.

<DT><CODE>ci: <VAR>file</VAR>,v: bad diff output line: Binary files - and /tmp/T2a22651 differ</CODE>
<DD>
CVS 1.9 and older will print this message
when trying to check in a binary file if
RCS is not correctly installed.  Re-read the
instructions that came with your RCS distribution
and the INSTALL file in the CVS
distribution.  Alternately, upgrade to a current
version of CVS, which checks in files itself
rather than via RCS.

<DT><CODE>cvs checkout: could not check out <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With CVS 1.9, this can mean that the <CODE>co</CODE> program
(part of RCS) returned a failure.  It should be
preceded by another error message, however it has been
observed without another error message and the cause is
not well-understood.  With the current version of CVS,
which does not run <CODE>co</CODE>, if this message occurs
without another error message, it is definitely a CVS
bug (see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>).

<DT><CODE>cvs [login aborted]: could not find out home directory</CODE>
<DD>
This means that you need to set the environment
variables that CVS uses to locate your home directory.
See the discussion of HOME, HOMEDRIVE, and HOMEPATH in
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC174">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>.

<DT><CODE>cvs update: could not merge revision <VAR>rev</VAR> of <VAR>file</VAR>: No such file or directory</CODE>
<DD>
CVS 1.9 and older will print this message if there was
a problem finding the <CODE>rcsmerge</CODE> program.  Make
sure that it is in your <CODE>PATH</CODE>, or upgrade to a
current version of CVS, which does not require
an external <CODE>rcsmerge</CODE> program.

<DT><CODE>cvs [update aborted]: could not patch <VAR>file</VAR>: No such file or directory</CODE>
<DD>
This means that there was a problem finding the
<CODE>patch</CODE> program.  Make sure that it is in your
<CODE>PATH</CODE>.  Note that despite appearances the message
is <EM>not</EM> referring to whether it can find <VAR>file</VAR>.
If both the client and the server are running a current
version of CVS, then there is no need for an
external patch program and you should not see this
message.  But if either client or server is running
CVS 1.9, then you need <CODE>patch</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>cvs update: could not patch <VAR>file</VAR>; will refetch</CODE>
<DD>
This means that for whatever reason the client was
unable to apply a patch that the server sent.  The
message is nothing to be concerned about, because
inability to apply the patch only slows things down and
has no effect on what CVS does.

<DT><CODE>dying gasps from <VAR>server</VAR> unexpected</CODE>
<DD>
There is a known bug in the server for CVS 1.9.18
and older which can cause this.  For me, this was
reproducible if I used the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> global option.  It
was fixed by Andy Piper's 14 Nov 1997 change to
src/filesubr.c, if anyone is curious.
If you see the message,
you probably can just retry the operation which failed,
or if you have discovered information concerning its
cause, please let us know as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>.

<DT><CODE>end of file from server (consult above messages if any)</CODE>
<DD>
The most common cause for this message is if you are
using an external <CODE>rsh</CODE> program and it exited with
an error.  In this case the <CODE>rsh</CODE> program should
have printed a message, which will appear before the
above message.  For more information on setting up a
CVS client and server, see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC26">Remote repositories</A>.

<A NAME="IDX554"></A>
<DT><CODE>cvs commit: Executing 'mkmodules'</CODE>
<DD>
This means that your repository is set up for a version
of CVS prior to CVS 1.8.  When using CVS
1.8 or later, the above message will be preceded by


<PRE>
cvs commit: Rebuilding administrative file database
</PRE>

If you see both messages, the database is being rebuilt
twice, which is unnecessary but harmless.  If you wish
to avoid the duplication, and you have no versions of
CVS 1.7 or earlier in use, remove <CODE>-i mkmodules</CODE>
every place it appears in your <CODE>modules</CODE>
file.  For more information on the <CODE>modules</CODE> file,
see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC153">The modules file</A>.

<DT><CODE>missing author</CODE>
<DD>
Typically this can happen if you created an RCS file
with your username set to empty.  CVS will, bogusly,
create an illegal RCS file with no value for the author
field.  The solution is to make sure your username is
set to a non-empty value and re-create the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>*PANIC* administration files missing</CODE>
<DD>
This typically means that there is a directory named
CVS but it does not contain the administrative files
which CVS puts in a CVS directory.  If the problem is
that you created a CVS directory via some mechanism
other than CVS, then the answer is simple, use a name
other than CVS.  If not, it indicates a CVS bug
(see section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>).

<DT><CODE>rcs error: Unknown option: -x,v/</CODE>
<DD>
This message will be followed by a usage message for
RCS.  It means that you have an old version of
RCS (probably supplied with your operating
system).  CVS only works with RCS version 5 and
later.

<DT><CODE>cvs [server aborted]: received broken pipe signal</CODE>
<DD>
This message seems to be caused by a hard-to-track-down
bug in CVS or the systems it runs on (we don't
know--we haven't tracked it down yet!).  It seems to
happen only after a CVS command has completed, and
you should be able to just ignore the message.
However, if you have discovered information concerning its
cause, please let us know as described in section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC181">Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual</A>.

<DT><CODE>Too many arguments!</CODE>
<DD>
This message is typically printed by the <TT>`log.pl'</TT>
script which is in the <TT>`contrib'</TT> directory in the
CVS source distribution.  In some versions of
CVS, <TT>`log.pl'</TT> has been part of the default
CVS installation.  The <TT>`log.pl'</TT> script gets
called from the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> administrative file.
Check that the arguments passed in <TT>`loginfo'</TT> match
what your version of <TT>`log.pl'</TT> expects.  In
particular, the <TT>`log.pl'</TT> from CVS 1.3 and
older expects the logfile as an argument whereas the
<TT>`log.pl'</TT> from CVS 1.5 and newer expects the
logfile to be specified with a <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option.  Of
course, if you don't need <TT>`log.pl'</TT> you can just
comment it out of <TT>`loginfo'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>cvs commit: Up-to-date check failed for `<VAR>file</VAR>'</CODE>
<DD>
This means that someone else has committed a change to
that file since the last time that you did a <CODE>cvs
update</CODE>.  So before proceeding with your <CODE>cvs
commit</CODE> you need to <CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  CVS will merge
the changes that you made and the changes that the
other person made.  If it does not detect any conflicts
it will report <SAMP>`M cacErrCodes.h'</SAMP> and you are ready
to <CODE>cvs commit</CODE>.  If it detects conflicts it will
print a message saying so, will report <SAMP>`C cacErrCodes.h'</SAMP>,
and you need to manually resolve the
conflict.  For more details on this process see
section <A HREF="cvs.html#SEC80">Conflicts example</A>.

<DT><CODE>Usage:        diff3 [-exEX3 [-i | -m] [-L label1 -L label3]] file1 file2 file3</CODE>
<DD>

<PRE>
Only one of [exEX3] allowed
</PRE>

This indicates a problem with the installation of
<CODE>diff3</CODE> and <CODE>rcsmerge</CODE>.  Specifically
<CODE>rcsmerge</CODE> was compiled to look for GNU diff3, but
it is finding unix diff3 instead.  The exact text of
the message will vary depending on the system.  The
simplest solution is to upgrade to a current version of
CVS, which does not rely on external
<CODE>rcsmerge</CODE> or <CODE>diff3</CODE> programs.

<DT><CODE>warning: unrecognized response `<VAR>text</VAR>' from cvs server</CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>text</VAR> contains a valid response (such as
<SAMP>`ok'</SAMP>) followed by an extra carriage return
character (on many systems this will cause the second
part of the message to overwrite the first part), then
it probably means that you are using the <SAMP>`:ext:'</SAMP>
access method with a version of rsh, such as most
non-unix rsh versions, which does not by default
provide a transparent data stream.  In such cases you
probably want to try <SAMP>`:server:'</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`:ext:'</SAMP>.  If <VAR>text</VAR> is something else, this
may signify a problem with your CVS server.
Double-check your installation against the instructions
for setting up the CVS server.

<DT><CODE>cvs commit: warning: editor session failed</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
This means that the editor which CVS is using exits with a nonzero
exit status.  Some versions of vi will do this even when there was not
a problem editing the file.  If so, point the
CVSEDITOR environment variable to a small script
such as:


<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
vi $*
exit 0
</PRE>

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC178" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC178">Trouble making a connection to a CVS server</A></H2>

<P>
This section concerns what to do if you are having
trouble making a connection to a CVS server.  If
you are running the CVS command line client
running on Windows, first upgrade the client to
CVS 1.9.12 or later.  The error reporting in
earlier versions provided much less information about
what the problem was.  If the client is non-Windows,
CVS 1.9 should be fine.

</P>
<P>
If the error messages are not sufficient to track down
the problem, the next steps depend largely on which
access method you are using.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>:ext:</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>

Try running the rsh program from the command line.  For
example: "rsh servername cvs -v" should print CVS
version information.  If this doesn't work, you need to
fix it before you can worry about CVS problems.

<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
<DT><CODE>:server:</CODE>
<DD>
You don't need a command line rsh program to use this
access method, but if you have an rsh program around,
it may be useful as a debugging tool.  Follow the
directions given for :ext:.

<A NAME="IDX558"></A>
<DT><CODE>:pserver:</CODE>
<DD>
One good debugging tool is to "telnet servername
2401".  After connecting, send any text (for example
"foo" followed by return).  If CVS is working
correctly, it will respond with


<PRE>
cvs [pserver aborted]: bad auth protocol start: foo
</PRE>

If this fails to work, then make sure inetd is working
right.  Change the invocation in inetd.conf to run the
echo program instead of cvs.  For example:


<PRE>
2401  stream  tcp  nowait  root /bin/echo echo hello
</PRE>

After making that change and instructing inetd to
re-read its configuration file, "telnet servername
2401" should show you the text hello and then the
server should close the connection.  If this doesn't
work, you need to fix it before you can worry about
CVS problems.

On AIX systems, the system will often have its own
program trying to use port 2401.  This is AIX's problem
in the sense that port 2401 is registered for use with
CVS.  I hear that there is an AIX patch available
to address this problem.

Neither CVS nor this manual is perfect, and they
probably never will be.  If you are having trouble
using CVS, or think you have found a bug, there
are a number of things you can do about it.  Note that
if the manual is unclear, that can be considered a bug
in the manual, so these problems are often worth doing
something about as well as problems with CVS itself.

If you got CVS through a distributor, such as an
operating system vendor or a vendor of freeware
CD-ROMs, you may wish to see whether the
distributor provides support.  Often, they will provide
no support or minimal support, but this may vary from
distributor to distributor.

If you have the skills and time to do so, you may wish
to fix the bug yourself.  If you wish to submit your
fix for inclusion in future releases of CVS, see
the file HACKING in the CVS source
distribution.  It contains much more information on the
process of submitting fixes.

There may be resources on the net which can help.  Two
good places to start are:

If you are so inspired, increasing the information
available on the net is likely to be appreciated.  For
example, before the standard CVS distribution
worked on Windows 95, there was a web page with some
explanation and patches for running CVS on Windows
95, and various people helped out by mentioning this
page on mailing lists or newsgroups when the subject
came up.

It is also possible to report bugs to <CODE>bug-cvs</CODE>.
Note that someone may or may not want to do anything
with your bug report--if you need a solution consider
one of the options mentioned above.  People probably do
want to hear about bugs which are particularly severe
in consequences and/or easy to fix, however.  You can
also increase your odds by being as clear as possible
about the exact nature of the bug and any other
relevant information.  The way to report bugs is to
send email to <CODE>bug-cvs@gnu.org</CODE>.  Note
that submissions to <CODE>bug-cvs</CODE> may be distributed

you don't like this, don't submit them.  There is
usually no justification for sending mail directly to
one of the CVS maintainers rather than to
<CODE>bug-cvs</CODE>; those maintainers who want to hear
about such bug reports read <CODE>bug-cvs</CODE>.  Also note
that sending a bug report to other mailing lists or
newsgroups is <EM>not</EM> a substitute for sending it to
<CODE>bug-cvs</CODE>.  It is fine to discuss CVS bugs on
whatever forum you prefer, but there are not
necessarily any maintainers reading bug reports sent
anywhere except <CODE>bug-cvs</CODE>.

People often ask if there is a list of known bugs or
whether a particular bug is a known one.  The file
BUGS in the CVS source distribution is one
list of known bugs, but it doesn't necessarily try to
be comprehensive.  Perhaps there will never be a
comprehensive, detailed list of known bugs.
