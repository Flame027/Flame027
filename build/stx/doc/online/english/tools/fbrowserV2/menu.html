This function is normally not needed, since
the fileBrowser checks for modifications
of the current directory in regular intervals,
updating the list automatically every few seconds.

(for example, if the time/dates are out of sync between NFS hosts)
or if you do not want to wait for the next automatic update.

<H3><A NAME="MENU_EXTRAS" HREF="TOP.html#I_MENU_EXTRAS">Extras Submenu Functions</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="MENU.ENCODING">Encoding ...</A>
<DD>opens a dialog to specify the file's encoding to use.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Character Encoding (charset)
<BR>
By default, the file browser assumes ISO8859-1 encoding,
and tries to figure out a file's encoding (by heuristic rules),
when a file's contents is read (eg. by double clicking).
Usually, UTF-8 encoded files are detected, and the charset-encoding changed
as appropriate.
<P>
This autoselect may fail sometimes,
and a specific encoding can be enforced via this menu,
by first choosing an encoding and setting the "Lock" check toggle, to prevent further
attempts in autoselecting.
<P>

<LI>Line End Convention
<BR>
Different operating systems traditionally used different line-end encodings.
By default, ST/X uses the Unix convention, where end-of-line is marked by a
NL (Newline, ascii 10) character. If you edit a file with a different line end
convention, change to CR-NL (for MSDOS family of operating systems),
CR (for VMS and older Macintosh operating systems), or one of th special conventions,
which are only useful to write files for mainframes or some more exotic modem
protocols.
<P>

<LI>Tab Stops
<BR>
ST/X assumes that tabs in a file are conforming to the historic standard
of forwarding to the next multiple of 8 spaces.
When reading a file, tabs are always converted to an appropriate number of spaces,
and treated as such in the editor.
I.e. the text editor does not show or handle tabs at all.
When writing a file, leading sequences of spaces (but only those)
are converted to a number of tab characters.
