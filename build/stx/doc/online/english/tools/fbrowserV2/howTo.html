<H3>File Manipulations</H3>

<H4><A NAME="RENAMING_FILES">Bulk Rename (Renaming multiple files)</A></H4>
When multiple files are to be renamed according to a common rename pattern
(for example, adding a common prefix, suffix or replacing some part of the fileName),
select all files which are to be renamed, and select the <I>"Rename"</I> menu item.
<BR>
You can now either individually rename each file, or press the <I>"Rename All"</I>-Button,
which will rename all remaining files by the same character replacement algorithm.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="ERASING_FILES">Erasing Files (With Security Relevant Data)</A></H4>
A regular file-delete operation does not physically delete the file's contents
on your hard disk; instead, it is only logically removed from the directory.
The contents will still be physically present on your hard disk, until the disk
blocks get reused for another file.
Thus there is a chance that a deleted file's contents can be reconstructed by
so called "unerase tools", which find and reallocate such free disk blocks.
<BR>
The erase function helps to prevent this, by
overwriting a file's data blocks physically, before the file is deleted logically.
Be aware that erasing is much slower than a regular delete operation, because the file
is completely rewritten before.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>You should use this function to erase files containing security relevant data,
such as cryptographic keys, passwords, banking data etc.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A NAME="SPLITTING_FILES">Splitting a Big File</A></H4>
This operation splits a big file into smaller pieces.
It is very useful if you have to save a big file onto multiple CDs or USB sticks,
or to prepare a big file for transmission in smaller junks, if mailboxes limit the maximum size of
attachments.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="JOINING_FILES">Joining Pieces of a Big File</A></H4>
This is the reverse of the above split operation;
multiple smaller parts are joined into a big file.

<H3>Searching & Comparing</H3>

<H4><A NAME="COMPARING_FILES">Comparing two Files</A></H4>
To compare the contents of two files
(for example, to validate a burned CD's or DVD's contents),
first select a file in the browser's upper file list,
then select the <I>"Tools - File Differences"</I> menu item.
This will open a dialog to select the second file to be compared to the first one.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="SEARCHING_DUPLICATE_FILES">Searching for Duplicate Files</A></H4>
This operation is very useful, if you merge MP3 or Video collections,
and duplicate files are likely to be present.
