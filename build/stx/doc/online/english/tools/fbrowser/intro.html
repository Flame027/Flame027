FileBrowsers allow inspection and manipulation of files
and directories.
In addition to inspecting directories, you can
also use them as an editor for text files.
Finally, they can be used to load (and compile)
Smalltalk source code into the system.
<P>
A fileBrowser can be either started by the
<A HREF="../misc/TOP.html#LAUNCHER">Launcher</A>
<BR>
or by evaluating the Smalltalk expression
<BR>
<A TYPE="example">
<CODE><PRE>
    FileBrowser open
</PRE></CODE>
</A>
in a
<A HREF="../misc/TOP.html#WORKSPACE">Workspace</A>
or from within your program.
<P>
The above starts the fileBrowser in the current directory.
To start a browser on some other directory, evaluate:
<BR>
<CODE><PRE>
    FileBrowser openOn:'someDirectory'
</PRE></CODE>

<P>
Typically, after startup, a fileBrowser looks like:
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../pictures/fbrowser.gif" ALT="[fig: filebrowser hardcopy]">
<P>
It consists of 4 subviews; these are:

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="pathField.html">path field</A>
<BR>shows the name of the current directory
<P>
<LI><A HREF="#PATTERNFIELD">file pattern field</A>
<BR>allows a match pattern to be entered
<P>
<LI><A HREF="fileList.html">file list</A>
<BR>shows file- and directory names
<P>
<LI><A HREF="contentsView.html">contents view</A>
<BR>shows a files contents
<P>
<LI><A HREF="commandView.html">OS command view</A> (not shown in above figure)
<BR>allows input of OS (UNIX-) commands
</OL>

<P>
To see the contents of a file, simply double-click on the
corresponding name entry in the file list. If the
selected item is a text file, its contents is shown in the
lower (contents-) view.
<BR>
If its a bitmap image file (TIFF, JPG etc.), an image inspector
is opened on its contents.
<BR>
If the item
name represents a directory, a change-directory into this
directory is performed.
<P>
When changing directories, the fileBrowser will automatically look for
a file named <CODE>".dir.info"</CODE> or <CODE>"README"</CODE>
and show its contents if present. (so, its a good idea to create such
a file in every directory, to lead your friends through the directory jungle.)
<P>
<A NAME = "PATTERNFIELD">The</A>
file list will only show files matching the pattern in
the pattern field, which is by default <CODE>"*"</CODE>, thus matching all
files. Directories are always shown, unaffected by the match pattern.
To change the match pattern, move the mouse pointer into the pattern
field, edit the pattern and type return
(or <VAR>accept</VAR> in the pattern fields own popupMenu).
<P>

All of the above mentioned subviews provide a popup menu, which is
activated by the middle mouse button
(or the right button, if you use a 2-button mouse).
<P>

<DL>
<DT>By the way:
<DD>
pressing an alphabetic key in the fileList will make it scroll
to the next entry whose name starts with that character.
If you press <KBD>"<B>SHIFT</B>"</KBD> at the same time, it will
find the previous entry starting with that character.
<BR>
Typing <KBD>"<B>RETURN</B>"</KBD> performs the double click function
on the selected entry.
<BR>
Also notice that <KBD>"<B>CURSOR_UP</B>"</KBD>, <KBD>"<B>CURSOR_DOWN</B>"</KBD>
<KBD>"<B>HOME</B>"</KBD> and <KBD>"<B>END</B>"</KBD> keys
too can be used to change the selection, while <KBD>"<B>PAGE_UP</B>"</KBD>
and <KBD>"<B>PAGE_DOWN</B>"</KBD>
scroll the list.
<BR>
This is true for all views which show a list to select entries from.
