  Especially beginners should not change the definition of any existing system class,
  but stick to their private ones. (Even 'gurus' think twice before doing that :- .)
<BR>
  The <CODE>"copy class"</CODE> or <CODE>"copy category"</CODE> functions are very helpful when creating experimental versions
  of new classes - they allow for very quick class duplication.
<P>
  So, instead of modifying any existing class, it is better to either create a copy of
  an existing class, or to create a new empty one and copy some methods over from the original one.
<BR>
  Then test & debug the new class for perfection.
<P>
  Of course, when done, you should override the old class with the class <VAR>"Class"-"Rename"</VAR> function,
  and avoid code duplication.
<P>
  This approach is especially suggested when you modify classes which are used by
  the system itself (for example: container- or UI-classes), since bugs in those may lead to subtile errors or even crashes.
<BR>
  (Just consider modifying <CODE>ScrollBar</CODE> to make it err somewhere;
   since the Debugger uses scrollBars too, it may have problems coming up.
   As a result, you might be forced to quit Smalltalk and restart your session,
   unless you are able to undo your change in the MiniDebugger).
<P>
We suggest that you save a snapshot image BEFORE starting to modify any critical system
class - actually, its a good idea to do regular snapshots in any case.
Then, you can resume from the last snapshot and examine and reapply individual
changes using the <A HREF="..\cbrowser\TOP.html">ChangesBrowser</A>.

  It may happen, that the browser shows funny source code in the codeview (totally
  wrong, empty code or off by some characters). This happens, when a sourcefile
  has been changed or removed from outside the browser (i.e. with FileBrowser or
  any other editor/program) and the system has not been recompiled or
  relinked yet (i.e. the compiled class in the executable is not up-to-date).
<P>
  Since the source information in a method is simply the <VAR>filename</VAR>+<VAR>filePosition</VAR>,
  this information is wrong after such a change.
<P>
  A recompile (using <VAR>stc</VAR>) followed by a relink of the Smalltalk executable, should
  give you a version with correct (up-to-date) source information.
  (however, the demo version does not include <VAR>stc</VAR> - here you have to undo any
   outside world editing, and only change methods from within the SystemBrowser).
<P>
  We recommend use of the sourceCode manager, which is able to access a classes
  sourcecode from the source repository, and does not need source files.
<BR>
  Here, the above problems are unlikely to occur (unless someone changes the classes
  version identification manually ...)
