<H2><A NAME="INTRO" HREF="TOP.html#I_INTRO">The Translation Scheme in Smalltalk/X</A></H2>

In ST/X, language translations come from external files,
which basically contain key-value pairs.
This is similar to schemes in other languages,
however, in ST/X, the english original string is used as key,
not cryptic number, as in most other such schemes.

<P>
Our experience showed that there are good reasons for such a scheme:
<OL>
<LI>programmers can search for the english original string
<LI>programmers see in the code, what is shown in a particular label, dialog, etc.
<LI>language translations can be easily added later
<LI>even english-to-english translations are possible, by providing an "en.rs" file.
This is useful to fix typos in already deployed code.
<LI>although we damand english as original language, third party private developers may
choose any language as original and provide translations for other languages later.
Including english.
<LI>No special tools are needed to edit and maintain language translation files.
They can be given to a translator without a need for deeper expertise in handling any special
editor or tool.
</OL>

<H2>Programmer API</H2>

<H3>Getting the Resources</H3>
Whenever a programmer needs a user-readable string (i.e. a UI-string),
he/she writes:
<CODE>"resources string:'<string to be xlated>'.</CODE> instead
of using the plain string.
<P>
The variable "resources" is an instance variable of ApplicationModel,
thus every UI application automatically gets the required translations.
<P>
Class methods can refer to this via <CODE>"self classResources"</CODE>.
<P>
If your class is not inheriting from ApplicationModel,
use "self class classResources" or "self projectDefinitionClass classResources".

<H3>Getting a String Translated</H3>

For most situations, the above simple translation message is sufficient.
However, often, other strings need to be embedded inside a UI-String.
Typically, these are numeric values, file names etc.
For this, use <CODE>"resources string:'...%1..' with:argument</CODE>, which
first translates the string, then expands the %i with corresponding argumens from
the with:-list. Up to 5 parameters can be provided by with:, with:with:... methods.
More arguments are passed by the <CODE>"withArguments:{ arg1 . ... argN }"</CODE> array construct.
<P>
You should never ever concatenate individually translated string pieces,
because different languages may have a different word order (subject-predicate-object),
and thus often require different word ordering.
<P>
For this, a string such as 'bla bla %1 and %2 with %3" can be given as UI string,
and translated to a string like "%1 und %2 sowie %3 wurden bla bla".
<P>
Finally, in some cases, a resource string may spawn multiple lines,
and the newline-escape character should be escaped to linebreaks.
However, this must happen before the expansion, as otherwise MSDOS-filenames woulf
be presented in multiple lines.
For this, use the
<CODE>"resources stringWithCRs:'...%1..' with:arg ...</CODE> message.
