  Especially beginners should not change the definition of any existing class, but
  stick to their private ones. (even 'gurus' think twice before doing that :-)
<BR>
  The <CODE>"copy category"</CODE> function is very helpful when creating experimental versions
  of new classes - it allows a very quick class duplication.
<P>
  So, instead of modifying any existing class, it is better to create a new one and
  copy all methods over from the original one.
<BR>
  Then test & debug the new class until perfect.
<BR>
  When done, you can override the old one with the class <CODE>"rename"</CODE> function.
<P>
  This approach is especially suggested when you modify classes which are used by
  the system itself, since bugs in those may lead to subtile errors or even crashes.
<BR>
  (just consider modifying <CODE>ScrollBar</CODE> to make it err somewhere; since the Debugger
   uses scrollBars too, it may have problems coming up. As a result, you
   might be forced to quit Smalltalk and restart your session).

  It may happen, that the browser shows funny source code in the codeview (totally
  wrong, empty code or off by some characters). This happens, when a sourcefile
  has been changed or removed from outside the browser (i.e. with FileBrowser or
  any other editor/program) and the system has not been recompiled or
  relinked yet (i.e. the compiled class in the executable is not up-to-date).
<P>
  Since the source information in a method is simply the <VAR>filename</VAR>+<VAR>filePosition</VAR>,
  this information is wrong after such a change.
<P>
  A recompile (using <VAR>stc</VAR>) followed by a relink of the Smalltalk executable, should
  give you a version with correct (up-to-date) source information.
  (however, the demo version does not include <VAR>stc</VAR> - here you have to undo any
   outside world editing, and only change methods from within the SystemBrowser).
<P>
  The commercial versions include a sourceCode manager, which is able to access a classes
  sourcecode from the source resository - it does not need any source files.
<BR>
  Here, the above problems are unlikely to occur (unless someone changes the classes
  version identification manually ...)
<P>
