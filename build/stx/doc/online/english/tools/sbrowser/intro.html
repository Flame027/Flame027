  SystemBrowsers are the main tools for programming in Smalltalk;
  they allow you to both browse through the system, search for a method and
  to create, modify or remove classes and methods.
<P>
  The standard System Browser consists of 5 major subviews; these components are:
<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../pictures/SystemBrowser.gif" ALT="[systemBrowser hardcopy]">
<P>
<OL>
<LI>class category list
<LI>class list
<LI>class/instance toggle
<LI>method category list
<LI>method list
<LI>code view
</OL>
<P>
(the actual appearance of the Browser depends on the viewStyle setting;
the picture above was taken with the "iris-style" in effect)
<P>
Notice:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This document describes the pre 2.10.4 systemBrowser.
In later releases, additional views presenting the instance
variables of the current class and for namespace selection
have been added.
<BR>
The menu items for
variable-searches are now found in the variableLists popup menu.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Class Category List</H3>
<P>
  Within the system, all classes are assigned to a class category,
  this category has NO semantic function of any kind, it is simply
  an attribute, to group classes for easier handling.
  (actually, beside the browser, there are not many uses of class categories.)
<P>
  Once a class category is selected (by clicking on the entry in the
  class category list), the class list shows all classes belonging to
  that category.
<BR>
  The systemBrowser also offers two "special" categories:
<CODE>"* all *"</CODE>
  which will display all classes and show them alphabetically,
  and
<CODE>"* hierarchy *"</CODE>
  which also shows all classes, but indents them by inheritance as a tree.

<H3>Class List</H3>
  Selecting a class in the class list, will show all method categories
  in the method category list.

<H3>Method Category (Protocol) List</H3>
  Like class categories, method categories are only used
  for grouping related methods; typically, methods are categorized
  by function or effect. Like class categories, these have no semantic effect.
  Method categories are also often referred to as "protocols".
<P>
  Selecting a method category will show all methods in that category.
  The special category
<CODE>"* all *"</CODE>
shows all methods in alphabetic order.

<H3>Method List</H3>
  Finally, selecting a method in the method list will show the corresponding
  method's source code in the code view.
<BR>
Notice that, if the classes source file has been removed, or is not accessible,
the codeview will show the string <CODE>"no source available"</CODE>.
<P>
  Also keep in mind, that these lists (like all selection lists) respond to keyboard events:
  especially, alpha-keys (search for the next entry with that character),
<KBD>cursor UP/DOWN</KBD>,
<KBD>page UP/DOWN</KBD>,
<KBD>HOME</KBD> and
<KBD>END-</KBD>keys
are useful for navigation.
<P>
  For examples on
<A NAME="I_HOWTO"     HREF="hints.html#HOWTO">typical uses</A> of the browser,
see the last section(s) of this document.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="CLASS_VS_INST" HREF="TOP.html#I_CLASS_VS_INST">Class vs. Instance</A></H2>

  The browser allows working on both a class and its metaclass (i.e. the
  classes class). Smalltalk beginners should keep in mind, that classes are
  objects like anything else in the system - thus the behavior of classes is described
  by another class (the so called <VAR>metaclass</VAR>).
  The set of messages understood by instances of a
  class is called <VAR>instance protocol</VAR>,
  while the set of messages understood by the class
  is called the <VAR>class protocol</VAR>.
<BR>
  Just like instances inherit protocol from the superclass(es),
  class protocol is inherited
  from the metaclasses superclass(es).
<P>
  To switch, there are two toggle buttons named <CODE>"class"</CODE> and
  <CODE>"instance"</CODE>.
<BR>
  Selecting <CODE>"instance"</CODE> (which is the default) makes your changes
  affect the class, while selecting <CODE>"class"</CODE> makes them affect the metaclass.
<P>
If you are not too familiar with this concept, try the <CODE>"hierarchy"</CODE>
function of the class-lists popupMenu - especially take a careful look at this
hierarchy when looking at the <VAR>class protocol</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="DOUBLECLICK_CLASS" HREF="TOP.html#I_DOUBLECLICK_CLASS">Starting an Application by double clicking on a class</A></H2>

For your convenience, a double click on a class, which is
an application (i.e. subclass of ApplicationModel or a TopView application),
can be started (opened) by double clicking on the class.
<BR>
(actually, any class which returns true from the <CODE>#isVisualStartable</CODE> message
can be started this way)
<P>
Of course, this performs the same as evaluating "<VAR>className</VAR> <CODE>open</CODE>"
in a workspace.

<H2><A NAME="DOUBLECLICK_METHOD" HREF="TOP.html#I_DOUBLECLICK_METHOD">Opening a tool by double clicking on a method</A></H2>

For selectors, which are marked as windowSpec, menuSpec or imageSpec methods,
a corresponding editor application is opened on double-click.
<BR>
That means, that a GUI-Painter is opened when you double-click a windowSpec method,
or an imageEditor is opened when you double-click an imageSpec method.
