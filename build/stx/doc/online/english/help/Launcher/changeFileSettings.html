<!-- <H2><A NAME="LOG_METHODS" HREF="#INDEX">Remember changed methods</A></H2>

If enabled, the system will keep a history for every changed method,
which associates the method to its previous version.
This allows quick undoing of method changes (without a need to recompile
the method from its source).
<BR>
Notice, that this history will eat up lots of memory over time - you
should flush it occasionally via the memoryMonitors <VAR>flush method history</VAR>
menu item.
<BR>
The browser's <VAR>compare with previous</VAR> and <VAR>back to previous</VAR> items
in the method list menu are only available, if the method history is turned on.
<P>
It is a good idea to turn on this feature,
before modifications to the compiler classes
are attempted, since those can then be undone without a need for a working
compiler (in case you broke it). But make certain, that a SystemBrowser is
open ...

<H2><A NAME="LOG_COMPILES" HREF="#INDEX">Log compiles in changes file</A></H2>

If enabled, every class or method change will be recorded in
the changes file.
<BR>
Notice> it does NOT make any sense, to turn this off.


<H2><A NAME="LOG_DOITS" HREF="#INDEX">Log doIts in changes file</A></H2>

If enabled, every <VAR>doIt</VAR>, <VAR>printIt</VAR> and <VAR>inspectIt</VAR>
action done in browsers or inspectors will also be recorded in the changes file.
<BR>
It does not make sense, to turn this on, since the change file will probably grow
to a huge size over time.


<H2><A NAME="CHANGEFILE" HREF="#INDEX">Change file name</A></H2>

Names the file where changes are recorded.
<P>
If multiple users are working in the same directory, it is recommended, to use
separate changeFiles (updates are not automatically synchronized).
<P>
Changing the name temporarily may also be useful to separate changes
done in different projects.
