<H2><A NAME="USENEWSYSTEMBROWSER" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New System Browser</A></H2>

Controls if the new or old SystemBrowser should be used.
<BR>
The new SystemBrowser offers many additional features, among them:
multiple buffers, undo, advanced search functionality, refactory support and others.
<BR>
The default is on (i.e. to use the new SystemBrowser).





<H2><A NAME="USENEWVERSIONDIFFBROWSER" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New VersionDiff Browser</A></H2>

Controls if the new VersionDiffBroser or the old DiffView should be used,
when comparing a classes repository revision against the current version
(via the browser's class-repository submenu).
<BR>
The new VersionDiffBroser offers a nicer user interface, presenting
changes by individual methods. In contrast, the old diffViewer shows overall
differences, based upon a classes complete source.
<BR>
The default is on (i.e. to use the new DiffView).





<H2><A NAME="USENEWFILEBROWSER" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New File Browser</A></H2>

Controls if the new or old FileBrowser should be used.
<BR>
The new FileBrowser offers many additional features, among them:
multiple buffers, preview, hierarchical treeView and others.
<BR>
The default is on (i.e. to use the new FileBrowser).




<H2><A NAME="USENEWFILETREEDIALOG" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New File Tree Dialog</A></H2>

Controls if the new file tree dialog should be used.
<BR>
The new file tree dialog provides drag & drop, create directory,
multiple selection etc.
<BR>
The default is off (i.e. to use the old FileSelectionBox Dialog).




<H2><A NAME="USENEWSETTINGSDIALOG" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New Settings Dialog</A></H2>

Controls if the new settings dialog should be used.
<BR>
the new settings dialog provides all the STX settings in one hierarchical tree application
the menu entry is now found under System/Settings in the Launcher
<BR>
The default is on (i.e. to use the new Settings Dialog).




<H2><A NAME="USENEWCHANGESBROWSER" HREF="#INDEX">Use the New Changes Browser</A></H2>

Controls if the new or old ChangesBrowser should be used.
<BR>
The new ChangesBrowser presents a nicer user interface, but is missing some
advanced search and compress functions.
<BR>
Therefore, it is not recommened (yet).
<BR>
The default is off (i.e. to use the old ChangesBrowser).


<H2><A NAME="HIERARCHICALINSPECTOR" HREF="#INDEX">Use the Hierarchical Inspector</A></H2>

Controls if the hierarchical inspector should be used (as opposed to the
standard inspector) when an object is inspected.
<BR>
The hierarchical inspector allows for an objects references to be
followed without a need to open dozens of other inspector views.
<BR>
The default is off (i.e. the standard Inspector is used).



<H2><A NAME="SMALLTALKDOCUMENTVIEWER" HREF="#INDEX">Use the Smalltalk Document Viewer</A></H2>

Controls if the built-in ST/X viewer should be used to present the documentation,
or if a system tool (typically: Firefox or Internet Explorer) is used.
<BR>
The builtin tool is known to have some bugs in its handling of
tables and complicated layouts, therefore many documents will show up incorrect or
badly formatted.
<br>
However, it is much more convenient to view coding examples,
as it has some powerful interactive features builtIn,
which allow it to access internals of the
Smalltalk system (such as class definitions, or interpretive execution).
<P>
For example, the builtin viewer is able to display the results of a code-example's
evaluation right in the browser, which is not possible with the standard browsers.
<BR>
The default is on (i.e. the Smalltalk tool is used).
<P>
Notice, that none of the provided ST/X document files requires complicated layouts or
tables, so there is no need to use a more sophisticated browser.


<H2><A NAME="SHOWTIPOFTHEDAY" HREF="#INDEX">Show "Tip of the Day" at Startup</A></H2>
If on, a "Did you know - tip of the day" window is shown when ST/X
is started. You can also start this tool manually, via the launcher's
help menu.

<H2><A NAME="CLOCKINLAUNCHER" HREF="#INDEX">Show Clock in Launcher</A></H2>

Controls if a clock is shown in the launcher.
<BR>Normally, this is enabled, but you may want to disable the clock, if ST/X has its display connected
via a dialUp line (X-display via ISDN, for example),
to avoid the periodic redial/reconnect due to clock updates.




<H2><A NAME="TRANSCRIPTBUFFERSIZE" HREF="#INDEX">Transcript's Buffer Size</A></H2>

Controls how many lines of text are remembered in the Transcript window.
<BR>Increasing this number may lead to additional memory use.


<H2><A NAME="AUTORAISETRANSCRIPT" HREF="#INDEX">Autoraise Transcript</A></H2>
If on, the Transcript window will be automatically deiconified and raised, whenever
a new notification message is shown.
