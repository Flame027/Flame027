This source code manager was provided by a customer and
is not maintained by eXept itself.
It implements an interface to a Perforce (P4) repository.
<P>
For a general introduction to source code management,
please consult the
<A HREF="../../programming/sourcemanager.html">
"<I>Programmer's Guide to ST/X - Sourcecode & Revision Management</I>"</A>.


<H2><A NAME="SETTINGS" HREF="#INDEX">P4 Settings Dialog</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="BINARY_PATH" HREF="#INDEX">P4 Binary Executable Path</A></H3>

Optionally specifies the path to the <CODE>"p4"</CODE> command.
<BR>
A full path is only required if you do not have Perforce installed along the default <CODE>PATH</CODE>,
or if you want to use your own private version of the "<CODE>p4</CODE>" command.
Usually, the default "p4" is ok for the system to find it.


<H3><A NAME="P4_DEFAULT_ROOT" HREF="#INDEX">Perforce Root Default</A></H3>

Specifies the perforce ROOT for all classes which do not
belong to a module listed in the per-module list.
<BR>
I.e. its the fallback P4Root used for all other classes, not listed below.



<H3><A NAME="P4_PERMODULE_ROOT" HREF="#INDEX">Per Module Setup</A></H3>

In ST/X, class packages form a hierarchical tree and their files are mapped in the source
repository to subdirectories below a so called
module root. The module itslef is specified by the first component of a package
path.
For example:
<br>
The "Array"-class is found in the "stx:libbasic" package.
<BR>Therefore, its module is "stx" and its container is found in the "libbasic"
sub-directory, of the repository which has been associated to the "stx" module.
<P>
Placing your own packages into a separate module (typically, you would use your company name
as module-name) and specifying a separate root for this module, allows you to
manage your own classes in a separate source code repository.
<BR>
Of course, this also allows for multiple independent repositories to be defined and
maintained in bigger organizations.


<H3><A NAME="SOURCE_CACHE" HREF="#INDEX">Source Cache</A></H3>

Performing a slow checkOut operation for every class which is visited in
the browser does slow down the system's responses - especially the search functions
(senders/string-search etc.) may become unusably slow.
<BR>
To avoid this, the sourcecode-manager keeps track of already checked-out classes
and remembers those in a cacheDirectory. This cache may grow over time, as
it remembers multiple versions of all classes of which source code has ever been asked for.
<BR>
The default location for this cache is <CODE>"/tmp/stx_sourceCache"</CODE> (unix)
or <CODE>"&lt;userDefault&gt;\local files\Temp\stx_sourceCache"</CODE> (windows).
<BR>
Over time, this directory may grow and should be purged from time to time
(The purge operation removes old versions in the cache and leaves the youngest only).
<BR>
It is not dangerous, to remove those old files, as they will be re-checked out
as required (for example, when you do a "compare with previous" operation later).
