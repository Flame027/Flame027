This dialog allows for the formatting (pretty printer)
parameters to be configured.
<P>
Basically, there are 2 major formatting styles:
<ol>
<li>K&amp;R (Kernighan & Ritchie) Style
<li>Lisp Style
</ol>

<H2><A NAME="FORMAT_KR_STYLE" HREF="#INDEX">Kernighan &amp; Richtie Style</A></H2>
This style is used by more than 90% of all programmers and is based on
the style used in the UNIX operating system's C programs. It is named
after the original Unix authors.
Its main difference to the other style is that opening and closing parentheses
are each on a separate line from the enclosing statements or expressions.
This makes inserting & deleting lines easy. You can also easily find a block's
enclosing bracket, by moving down the cursor from the starting line's left column.
<BR>For example:
<CODE><PRE>
    ...
    someCondition ifTrue:[
	...
	[another condition] whileTrue:[
	    ...
	].
	...
	[
	    someCode
	] on:Error do:[
	    handlerCode
	]
    ]
</PRE></CODE>

<H2><A NAME="FORMAT_LISP_STYLE" HREF="#INDEX">Lisp Style</A></H2>
This style is used by the rest, and most Smalltalkers (but not the ST/X author!).
The opening parenthesis is on the same line as the first statement of a block,
and the closing parenthesis is appended to the last line.
This usually makes the code slightly denser (1 line per block),
but makes insertion/deletion of text to the beginning or end of a block a little more work.
<CODE><PRE>
    ...
    someCondition ifTrue:[
	...
	[another condition] whileTrue:[
	    ...].
	...
	[
	    someCode]
	on:Error do:[
	    handlerCode]]
</PRE></CODE>

The settings dialog allows for a quick change between these two styles.
<P>
Notice: all of ST/X has been written in the K&amp;R style
(with the exception of some imported code from friends and public domain sources).
and is the favourite style used and accepted by the author.
As it is mostly his task to fix bugs and maintain the code,
and it makes a huge difference when code has to be read and understood,
he highly recommends (actually demands) that tis style is used
when code is to be brought into ST/X.

<!--
<H2><A NAME="SYNTAXCOLORING" HREF="#INDEX">Syntax coloring</A></H2>

Controls if the syntax of methods should be highlighted in the
browser, by coloring entities.
<BR>
Colors and emphasis can be individually configured for various
syntactic and semantic entities, such as message selectors, comments,
global or local variables etc.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SELECTORCHECK" HREF="#INDEX">Immediate selector check</A></H2>

If on, a syntax check is done "while you type in new characters"
in the browser, and message selectors are checked on the fly.
<BR>
Any unimplemented message is highlighted (bold-red by default.
<BR>
You may want to disable this on a slow machine.
<P>
-->

<H2><A NAME="AUTOFORMAT" HREF="#INDEX">Automatic Code Formatting</A></H2>

If on, methods source code is formatted (pretty printed) automatically
when a method's source is displayed.
<BR>
For now, the formatter is not invoked on keyboard input;
you can reformat a changed method source via the popup menu.
<BR>
You may want to disable this, if you don't like the formatters output.
<P>
The formatter may be configured to either generate lisp-style or
c-style block format.
<P>
Warning: the formatter is based on the BRFormatter code ported from
the RefactoryBrowser package. Porting is still underway and there may be
bugs especially with ST/X extended syntax. The original formatter completely
lost any comment layout, which resulted in very ugly looking source code
(and is probably one reason, why many people did not comment their code!).
We tried to fix most of those issues (but who knows...).
Use at your own risk, and check if you like the output. If not, indent your code
manually.
