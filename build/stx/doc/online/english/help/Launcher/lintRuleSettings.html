The refactory browser package includes as number of
rule-based checks for common errors, compatibility issues
and code smells in Smalltalk programs.
<P>
Many additional rules have been added by eXept, some of
which cover prossible problems specific to the ST/X dialect
of Smalltalk.
<P>
These checks are bundled into so called "rule sets",
which can be created, maintained and customized by the user
for personal (or company wide) preferences.
<P>
This settings dialog allows for the creation and maintenance of
private rule sets. These are offered in the browser's
lint menu.

<H2><A NAME="PREDEFINED_RULES" HREF="#INDEX">Predefined Rules</A></H2>

One rule set is predefined and cannot be modified: it is the set
of all rules present in the system. New rule sets are
created by either creating one anew,
or by copying an existing rule set, and then modify the
included rules.
<P>
There are a number of questionable rules,
which are either too picky (and not all programmer teams
accept them) or which are not applicable to all
Smalltalk dialects. You should choose a reasonable set,
to both avoid overlooking common bugs,
and to not anger the programmers by constantly marking
perfectly good code. The later being just as bad, as
sooner or later, the programmer will completely ignore any such
hints, if he starts to get frustrated over non-issues.
