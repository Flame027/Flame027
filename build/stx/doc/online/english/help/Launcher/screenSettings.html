<H2><A NAME="SCREEN_SIZE" HREF="#INDEX">Visible Screen Area</A></H2>

The values specified here are used to compute the screen's actual resolution (pixel per inch)
This information is needed by some of ST/X's drawing windows to scale the output to the printed paper's size,
in order to get a 1:1 correct scaling of its graphics (i.e. to have 1cm on the screen being 1cm on the paper).
It is not required in most ST/X applications.
You should enter the size of the visible area (i.e. excluding any black frame of the screen).
<P>
If your display simulates a bigger virtual screen (i.e. an XFree server
with a bigger virtual screen), the size of the overall screen area must
to be entered (i.e. including the invisible part).
<BR>
This is because <CITE>ST/X</CITE> computes the resolution from the given screenSize and the display extent (in pixels).
However, there is usually no way to get information about the physical dimensions.
<P>
The exact resolution is required if you want 1:1 display of graphics;
for example, the DrawTool demo program adjusts its scaling to draw its figure in the actual (paper) size.
<BR>
Also, the PostscriptGraphicsContext class needs those values,
to adjust the printing scale and to compute font sizes for systems which do not provide postscript font metrics.
<BR>
Finally, some popup dialogs compute their default extent to be sized a certain number of millimeters or inches.
<P>

If the common-sizes list does not include a valid dimension for your actual monitor,
you should specify the size by entering the numeric values.
<P>
Notice, that <CITE>ST/X</CITE> asks the display (i.e. the Xserver / Windows)
about the screen dimensions. However, in practice, often the values as returned
are not realistic.
<P>
To have the screens size be set automatically at startup time,
add a line such as:
<CODE><PRE>
    Screen default widthInMillimeter:xxx; heightInMillimeter:yyy.
</PRE></CODE>
to your
<CODE>"display.rc"</CODE> file
(or to a display-specific <CODE>"d_xxx.rc"</CODE> file).


<H2><A NAME="SCREEN_USABLE_AREA" HREF="#INDEX">Limit Usable Screen Area</A></H2>
Use this to force a limit on the area used by ST/X widget classes.
Especially affects the boundary in which new windows, dialogs and popup menus are
shown.
<P>
Use this if you have a screen recorder active, which records some upper-left part of
your screen area, or if you have a beamer (secondary video output) attached,
and the graphics device has changed the resolution without telling the XServer about it
(or the XServer is ignoring that information). Especially the MAC XServer shows that behavior, in that
it still reports a screen area of the primary screen, although the resolution has been changed
when the external monitor was attached.


<H2><A NAME="SCREEN_COLOR" HREF="#INDEX">Color Monitor</A></H2>

Clear this checkBoxes mark, if you have a black & white monitor attached
to a color graphics card (or color X server).
<BR>
(Although <VAR>ST/X</VAR> asks the display about its color capabilities,
this question cannot be answered correctly in the above situation.)
<BR>
As specified in the styleSheet files, <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> chooses
different colors for cursors, selection highlighting etc. to assert use of contrasting colors.
Especially clear this, if you are running on a black & white laptop with a color VGA Xserver.
<P>
This setting originated in the 80's, when many displays were still b&amp;w.
Today, those are almost forgotten.

<H2><A NAME="FIXCOLORS" HREF="#INDEX">Fix Color Palette</A></H2>

This flag only affects graphic displays which use a limited (256-) color palette.
<P>
If enabled, <CITE>Smalltalk/X</CITE> preallocates 6x6x4 colors and
only uses those when bitmap images are displayed.
If disabled, colors are allocated as required.
<BR>
Enabling the fix colorMap, usually results in suboptimal image quality,
but the system will never run out of colors
- also, some colors remain to be used by other applications.
<P>
If disabled, your display may run out of available colors when images are displayed;
this might affect both Smalltalk itself and other graphical applications.
<P>
Since no colors have to be allocated from the display,
image rendering is much faster if the fixColor option is enabled.
<BR>
Especially, when viewing many images (for example: with the HTML browser).

<P>
On trueColor displays (i.e. 5x5x6 or even 8x8x8 available colors),
the above situation cannot happen - there, this setting is disabled.
<BR>
Therefore, if you have a choice when setting up your display hardware,
we recommend using the trueColor mode, if possible.
<P>
This setting originated in the 90's, when most color displays were using an 8bit
palette mapping scheme. Today, those are almost forgotten.



<H2><A NAME="FIXGRAYCOLORS" HREF="#INDEX">Fix Gray Color Palette</A></H2>

The same as above, for gray colors.
<BR>
If enabled, grayscale images can be rendered faster and <CITE>ST/X</CITE>
will not run out of gray colors when images are rendered.
<P>
This setting originated in the 80's and 90's, when many displays were still using
a greyscale b&amp;w screen (NeXt, for example).
Today, those are almost forgotten.



<H2><A NAME="DITHERING" HREF="#INDEX">Image Display</A></H2>

Selects the algorithm used to approximate colors in an image,
which are not available in the displays colormap.
<BR>
Typically, you can choose between <VAR>nearest paint</VAR>, which will choose
the nearest available color and <VAR>error diffusion</VAR> which also takes
the nearest color, but spreads the resulting error over surrounding pixels.
<BR>
The <VAR>error diffusion</VAR> algorithm usually results in higher quality
image display, but is slightly slower.
<P>
A good compromise between speed and image display quality is obtained
by using a fix color palette combined with the error diffusion algorithm.
<BR>
This will not run out of colors AND provides reasonably good image quality.
<P>
Owners of trueColor (i.e. 24bit/pixel) systems are lucky: they do not suffer
from the limited color problem and do not have to care for those settings.
<P>
This setting originated in the 80's and 90's, when many displays were still using
limited color or even greyscale screens.
Today, those are almost forgotten.



<H2><A NAME="GRAYICONS" HREF="#INDEX">Allow Color/Grayscale Icons</A></H2>

If disabled, grayscale or color icons are automatically converted to b&amp;w
dithered images, when used as window icon.
<BR>
This automatism was added for Xservers/window-managers which crash,
when a non-monochrome icon bitmap is installed.
<P>
Typically, this error does not exist in newer (X11R5 and later) Xservers.



<H2><A NAME="CLIPENCODING" HREF="#INDEX">Clipboard Encoding</A></H2>

This setting is only needed, when 16-bit strings are pasted
from the clipboard on systems which do not pass the clipBoards encoding
(i.e. some applications on the XWindow system).
<BR>
As each 16-bit character application may encode its clipBoard strings
in different ways, <CITE>ST/X</CITE> is prepared to convert it according
to the value defined here.
<P>
For example, when pasting japanese text which was selected in a netscape
browser, use <CODE>"EUC"</CODE> clipboard encoding.
<P>
For 'normal' ascii and iso8859 strings, this should be left as <VAR>"untranslated"</VAR>
(this is the default).



<H2><A NAME="CLIPLIMIT" HREF="#INDEX">Clipboard Buffer Size Limit</A></H2>

Whenever text is deleted or copied in a textView, ST/X copies the affected text to
the displays clipBoard. Some XServers are known to crash, if the size of this text exceeds
a certain limit or if the XServer runs out of memory due to swap space limitations.
<BR>
This field sets a maximum on the clipBoard size - text longer than this are
NOT copied to the displays clipBoard.
