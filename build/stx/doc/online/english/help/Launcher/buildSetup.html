<H2><A NAME="CVS_BUILD" HREF="#INDEX">Building via the CVS Repository</A></H2>

The standard procedure (at exept) is to use the CVS repository for building
deployable products. This is usually done by:
<OL>
<LI>creating a fresh working directory on a machine
<LI>checking out (a potentially tagged) repository state there.
This includes both a definite version of the stx base system and a version
of the application to be built. Normally, the application is to be built in a diretory
beside the stx top directory.
<LI>perform a build there.
On Windows, this creates a self-installable setup executable (NSS) in the application's
project directory. On Unix, an app-package is generated.
</OL>
Of course, all of this can be automated, as there is no Smalltalk image or browser interaction
required. Everything is controlled by makefiles.
The recommended way for automation is via a jenkins or expeccoNET scheduled build.

<H2><A NAME="LOCAL_BUILD" HREF="#INDEX">Building without Repository (Local Build)</A></H2>

For a local build, no repository is used. Instead, all files are generated in a
temporary build directory (sources, makefiles and support files).
Then, a normal make-controlled build is executed there.

<H3><A NAME="LOCAL_BUILD_COMPILER" HREF="#INDEX">Choosing a Compiler</A></H3>

Under unix/linux, the standard gnu compiler (gcc) is used for building.
<P>
On windows, you have the choice of:
<UL>
<LI>bcc32 - Borland cc
<br>the free borland compiler from the command line tools.
<p>
<LI>vc - Visual c (Microsoft)
<br>either the (Micrososft Visual C Express- or full version) or
non-free version. Only the command line tools are needed.
<p>
<LI>lcc - lcc
<br>not yet fully supported
<p>
<LI>gcc - gnu compiler (Cygwin)
<br>using the Cygwin tool chain (not yet fully supported)
</UL>
