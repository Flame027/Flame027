Controls if the syntax of methods should be highlighted in the
browser, by coloring entities.
<BR>
Colors and emphasis can be individually configured for various
syntactic and semantic entities, such as message selectors, comments,
global or local variables etc.
<P>
To change an element's presentation,
<OL>
<LI>select the element type (argument, global, etc.) in the list
<LI>check the color box if its color is to be changed
(leave unchecked, to keep these elements un-annotated)
<LI>if checked, choose a color
<LI>optionally, choose an emphasis (that is: style)
</OL>

A number of common styles can be quickly set by
selecting it in the common styles list, and pressing the "<I>Reset To</I>" button.


<P>

<H2><A NAME="SELECTORCHECK" HREF="#INDEX">Immediate Selector Check</A></H2>

If on, a syntax check is done "while you type in new characters"
in the browser, and message selectors are checked on the fly.
<BR>
Any unimplemented message is highlighted (bold-red by default.
<BR>
You may want to disable this on a slow machine.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="AUTOFORMAT" HREF="#INDEX">Automatic Code Formatting</A></H2>

(the formatter's settings have been moved to a separate tab recently.
See <A HREF="sourceFormatSettings.html">"Source Code Format Setings"</A>)
<!--
<P>
If on, methods source code is formatted (pretty printed) automatically
when a method's source is displayed.
<BR>
For now, the formatter is not invoked on keyboard input;
you can reformat a changed method source via the popup menu or the "Format" button.
<BR>
You may want to disable this, if you don't like the formatter's output.
<P>
The formatter may be configured to either generate lisp-style or
c-style block format.
<P>
Warning: the formatter is based on the BRFormatter code ported from
the RefactoryBrowser package. Porting is still underway and there may be
bugs especially with ST/X extended syntax. The original formatter completely
lost any comment layout, which resulted in very ugly looking source code
(and is probably one reason, why many people did not comment their code!).
We tried to fix most of those issues (but who knows...).
Use at your own risk, and check if you like the output. If not, indent your code
manually.
