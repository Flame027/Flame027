This source code manager implements a very simple versioning repository by
writing each version of a class as a separate plain file into a subdirectory of a root directory.
Its main use is as a sample implementation for more sophisticated source code managers.
It may also be useful for small classroom projects.
<P>
For a general introduction to source code management,
please consult the
<A HREF="../../programming/sourcemanager.html">
"<I>Programmer's Guide to ST/X - Sourcecode & Revision Management</I>"</A>.

<H3><A NAME="DEFAULT_ROOT" HREF="#INDEX">Root Default</A></H3>

Specifies the root directory of the repository for all classes which do not
belong to a module listed in the root-per-module list.
I.e. its the fallback root used for all other classes, not listed below.



<H3><A NAME="PERMODULE_ROOT" HREF="#INDEX">Root per Module</A></H3>

In ST/X, class packages form a hierarchical tree and are mapped in the
repository to source files located in subdirectories below the so called
module root. The module itself is specified by the first component of a package
path. If no "per-module" path is specified, the default root above is used.
<p>
For example:
The <CODE>Array</CODE>-class is found in the "<I>stx:libbasic</I>" package.
Therefore, its module is "<I>stx</I>",
and its version source files are found in the "<I>libbasic</I>" sub-directory,
of the repository which has been associated to the "<I>stx</I>" module.
<P>
This allows placing different packages into a separate code repositories.
