<H1>Welcome to the Smalltalk/X SystemBrowser</H1>

The SystemBrowser is used to explore, modify and enhance the Smalltalk class hierarchy.
In Smalltalk, there is no distinction between the IDE and the application program.
Therefore, both your application code and the system itself are accessible here.
Also, Smalltalk code is not file-based, but object oriented: the objects of interest here
are classes and methods. Classes are organized into packages, namespaces and categories.
Packages for packaging, namespaces to avoid name clashes, and categories to group them
by functionality.
