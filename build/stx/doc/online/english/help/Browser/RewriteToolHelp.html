<h2>How to Use this Tool</h2>

<h3>Step 1 - Write an ad-hoc rewrite rule, or use an existing one</h3>
<h3>Step 2 - Select the classes which are to be rewritten</h3>
<h3>Step 3 - Rewrite</h3>

<h2>Step 1a - Writing an Ad-Hoc Rewrite Rule</h2>
You should be a little familiar with search- and rewrite patterns of the Refactory Tool Suite.
If not, please consult the
<A HREF="RBSearchPatterns.html">Pattern Info</A>.
<P>
The "Search and Replace" tab contains two editors; enter the search pattern into the upper,
and the replacement into the lower editor.
Use the "Templates" tab for a number of examples.

<h2>Step 1b - Using an Existing Rule</h2>
A number of predefined common rules are available in the Refactory Tool Suite.
You can choose one of those, via the "Existing Rules" tab.
Of course, you can also copy search or replacement strings
from this, and paste it into an ad-hoc tab.

<h2>Step 2 - Select Classes Which are to be Rewritten</h2>

Go to the "Classes" tab,
and either drag&amp;drop the classes from a browser's class list into this view,
or press one of the buttons to include multiple classes (complete packages).

<h2>Step 2 - Rewrite</h2>

Go back to the "Search and Replace" tab, and either press "Search" (to search only) or
"Rewrite" to search and rewrite.
