as answer to a request.

<H2><A NAME="ROOT_DIR" HREF="#INDEX">Service Root Directory</A></H2>

    Specifies the directory which holds the service's files.
<p>



<H2><A NAME="DEFAULT_FILENAME" HREF="#INDEX">Default Filename</A></H2>

    Name of the file which is answered, if the requested file is not found.
<BR>
    If left empty, an error response will be generated for such a request.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="DIRECTORY_LISTING_ALLOWED" HREF="#INDEX">Directory Listing Allowed</A></H2>

    If on, clients are allowed to list the contents of a directory (by providing the directories
    name in the URL).
<BR>
    By default, the contents of a directory is not listed to clients,
    which means that a client needs to know a documents name (either via a link,
    or by other communication, or by guess)
<P>


<H2><A NAME="SHOW_WORLD_READABLE_ONLY" HREF="#INDEX">Show World Readable Files Only</A></H2>

    If on, only world-readable files are shown and provided.
    If off, all files which are accessible by the user-rights of the executing Smalltalk
    executable are accessible by clients.
<BR>
    By default, only world-readable files are visible to clients, for security reasons.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="ALLOW_REMOVE_FILE" HREF="#INDEX">Allow Remove File</A></H2>

    If on, clients are allowed to remove files on the server.
    This maz be useful if a directorz is used as a black-board or container for
    file exchange (i.e. upload/download directory), and the access is restricted by
    the authorization mechanism to a limited set of users.
<BR>
    By default, this is disabled, for security reasons.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="CHECK_REFERRER" HREF="#INDEX">Check Referrer (Inhibit Cross Links)</A></H2>

    If on, only allow files to be accessed which are referred from another document
    within originated from this host. I.e. do not allow cross-site references to
    these files from other sites and do not allow accesses which have been directly entered
    into the browser's URL-field by the user.
<BR>
    Notice, that this depends upon the HTTP-referrer field, which can be easily faked by
    modified browsers or hget-like programs. It is therefore not useful for any security or
    access control. It does, however, at least potentially reduce the amount of cross-site
    accesses.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="MAX_CACHE_SIZE" HREF="#INDEX">Max Nr. of Cached Files</A></H2>

    The number of file documents that will be held in memory for fast access.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="MAX_CACHE_DOCUMENT_SIZE" HREF="#INDEX">Max Cache Document Size</A></H2>

    The maximum size of a file document for caching.
    Files larger than that are not cached.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="CACHE_EXPIRATION_DELTA" HREF="#INDEX">Cache Expiration Delta</A></H2>

    Specifies the amount of time (in seconds),
    after which files which have not been accessed will be removed from the cache.
<p>



<H2><A NAME="EXPIRATION_DELTA" HREF="#INDEX">Expiration Delta</A></H2>

    Specifies the files expiration time (in hours) as reported to the web-browser.
    This is the time the browser is allowed to keep a local copy.
