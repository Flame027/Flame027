<H2><A NAME="FULLINSTALL" HREF="#FULLINSTALL">Full installation</A></H2>

The full installation will copy ALL files from the CD to some destination
directory on your hard disk. This allows you to recompile all Smalltalk/X
class libraries, to add additional classes/libraries and to change the
set of classes which are contained in your Smalltalk executable.
<BR>
A full installation is also required if you want to generate standAlone
executables.
<P>
For your convenience, precompiled object files for the compiled classes
are already contained on the CD, and will be copied into the specified
destination directory. This saves some time later, in that a full recompile
is not required.
<P>
Be aware, that a full installation requires quite some amount disk space,
especially, if all intermediate object files are kept (roughly 90-120Mb).
<P>


<H2><A NAME="PARTINSTALL" HREF="#PARTINSTALL">Partial installation</A></H2>

The partial installation only copies a preconfigured Smalltalk executable,
the required libraries and (optionally) the sources plus documentation
to your hard disk.
<BR>
A partial installation still provides all of the known Smalltalk environment,
but will not enable you to add additional precompiled classes to your
Smalltalk excutable.
<P>
A partial installation requires roughly 30-50Mb of disk space.




<H3><A NAME="BINDIR" HREF="#BINDIR">Binary directory</A></H2>

Specifies the directory where the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> binaries should be copied to
during a partial installation.
<BR>
These binaries include the <CITE>smalltalk</CITE> executable,
the <CITE>stc</CITE> compiler, and a few other executables and shell scripts.
<P>
The recommended directory is <CODE>"/usr/local/bin"</CODE> here.


<H3><A NAME="LIBBINDIR" HREF="#LIBBINDIR">Library directory</A></H2>

Specifies the directory where the <CITE>ST/X</CITE> libraries and shared libraries
should be copied to
during a partial installation.
<BR>
These include all the libXXX (possibly shared-) classLibraries.
<P>
If your system uses shared libraries (Linux-ELF, Unixware, IRIX, Solaris
and some others), this directory must be either one of the
standard library directories (<CODE>"/usr/local/lib"</CODE>,
<CODE>"/usr/lib"</CODE> or <CODE>"/lib"</CODE>),
or else be defined in the <CODE><STRONG>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</STRONG></CODE> environment variable.
<BR>
If you do not specify a standard directory, make certain that <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
is set correctly (add a corresponding entry to your <CODE>".profile"</CODE>
or <CODE>".login</CODE> file).
<P>
The recommended directory is <CODE>"/usr/local/lib"</CODE> here.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="LIBDIR" HREF="#LIBDIR">Help file directory</A></H2>

Specifies the directory where other <CITE>ST/X</CITE> help & auxiliary files
should be copied to
during a partial installation.
<BR>
These include bitmaps, configurations files, startup scripts and
resource files (which contain the national language translation strings).
<P>
For <CITE>ST/X</CITE> to be able to find those files,
these must be either installed to a standard location (<CODE>"/usr/local/lib/smalltalk"</CODE>,
<CODE>"/usr/lib/smalltalk"</CODE> or else define the location in
the <CODE><STRONG>STX_LIBDIR</STRONG></CODE> environment variable.
<BR>
If you do not specify a standard directory, make certain that <CODE>STX_LIBDIR</CODE>
is set correctly (add a corresponding entry to your <CODE>".profile"</CODE>
or <CODE>".login</CODE> file).
<P>
The recommended directory is <CODE>"/usr/local/lib/smalltalk"</CODE>.


<H2><A NAME="MORE_INFO" HREF="#INDEX">Further reading</A></H2>

You may want to read
<A HREF="../../installation/TOP.html">`how to install ST/X'</A>
for more details on the installation options. This document also
describes in detail, which files are going to be installed,
and where the end up.
<BR>
(This is mostly background information and not required
 in order to install and execute <CITE>ST/X</CITE>).
