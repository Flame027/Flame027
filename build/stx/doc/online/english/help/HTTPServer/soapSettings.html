Currently the ony setting that can be done here is to enable or disable SOAP
services (all or nothing).
<P>
The registration/deregistration must (currently) be done programmatically by
individual SOAP Services.
<BR>
See subclasses of SOAPService for details and examples.


<P>
It is planned to add a configuration scheme similar to the HTTPService setup scheme in the future.
