<HR>

<H2><A NAME="HOME_URL" HREF="#INDEX">Home URL</A></H2>

    A replacement URL which is used if "/" or an empty URL is requested.
    You can specify an arbitrary request URL,
    i.e. either a file in a FileService or any other services URL.
<BR>
    The default is <CODE>"/Home"</CODE>, which links to a corresponding service.
<BR>
    Typically, some homePageService is linked to <CODE>"/Home"</CODE>.
    (The default setup registers the <CODE>"Demos::WebHomePageForSTX"</CODE> service under the "/Home" url).
<BR>
    If no HomeURL is specified, the server will respond with a
    <CODE>"404 'Not Found'"</CODE> error response for requests with an empty URL.



<H2><A NAME="NOT_FOUND_URL" HREF="#INDEX">Not Found URL</A></H2>

    A URL which is used if a link cannot be resolved, i.e.
    if a nonEmpty, but bad name, bad suffix or bad directory was requested.
<P>
    This can be used to lead the web-user back to the home page,
    or to reply with some 'You bad-bad guy...' message
<BR>
    If left unspecified, the server will respond with a
    <CODE>"404 'Not Found'"</CODE> error response.


<HR>

<H2><A NAME="VERBOSE" HREF="#INDEX">Verbose</A></H2>

    Enable/disable tracing
<BR>
    e.g. request- and response-headers are traced on the Transcript.


<H2><A NAME="VERBOSE_ERRORS" HREF="#INDEX">Verbose Errors</A></H2>

    Enable/disable error tracing
<BR>
    e.g. errors are traced on the Transcript.


<H2><A NAME="VERBOSE_DATA" HREF="#INDEX">Verbose Data</A></H2>

    Enable/disable data tracing
<BR>
    e.g. request- and response-data is traced on the Transcript.


<H2><A NAME="DEBUG" HREF="#INDEX">Debug</A></H2>

    Enable/disable debugging.
<BR>
    If enabled, and any error occurs in the Server, while processing a request,
    the system enters the Smalltalk Debugger.
>BR>
    If the server runs as <A HREF="standaloneApplication.html">standalone application</A>,
    (without GUI), a MiniDebugger (line-by-line debugger) is entered.
<P>
    If disabled, errors are reported towards the webUser, and a
    <CODE>"500 'Internal Server Error'"</CODE> response is generated
    (with walkback informtion in the text-body).
<P>


<HR>

<H2><A NAME="MAX_KEEP_ALIVE_CONNECTIONS" HREF="#INDEX">Max Keep Alive Connections</A></H2>

    Defines the maximum number of kept alive connections.<P>
    That is the number of socket connections and possible handler threads
    that can be active at one time.


<H2><A NAME="INACTIVE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT" HREF="#INDEX">Inactive Connection Timeout</A></H2>

    Defines the time (in seconds) after which inactive kept-alive connections are shut down.


<H2><A NAME="TEMPORARY_LINK_EXPIRATION_TIME" HREF="#INDEX">Temporary Link Expiration Time</A></H2>

    Defines the time (in seconds) that temporary links are valid.
<BR>
    Temporary links are objects that will be stored under temporaryObjectNames
    (for example internally generated bitmap images).
    These temporary objects will be removed after that time.
<BR>
    This might be removed in the future, as individual services should care for any
    temporary, synthetic links for themself and a global (server-wide) expiration time
    is probably too coarse.

<H2><A NAME="REPLY_PRESENTER" HREF="#INDEX">Reply Presenter</A></H2>
    A reply-presenter is used to postprocess any HTML-output as generated by the http services.
    These representers can be used to wrap all generated text into a common-looking page layout,
    add decorators, backgrounds etc.
    Reply representors are specified both per-service and, as a fall-back, globally here in the server settings.
<br>
    For the reply presenter configuration of individual services, see <A HREF="pluggableServiceSettings.html">Service Configuration</A>.
<p>
    This dialog presents a list of all reply-presenter classes (subclasses of <CODE>ReplyPresenter</CODE>) to
choose from. If you add your own subclass, this will be listed here as well.
<br>
    By default, a presenter is used, which leaves the generated pages untouched (the "empty" reply presenter).


    <UL>
    <LI>EmptyDocumentReplyPresenter - the generated text is wrapped into the body part of a legal html document.
    <LI>ExeptReplyPresenter - The generated text is wrapped into a simple eXept presentation frame.
Take this as an example for your own representers.
    <LI>PlainReplyPresenter - the generated text is sent "as-is" (not even head and body are generated).
    </UL>
<BR>


<H2><A NAME="MAINTENANCE_MODE" HREF="#INDEX">Maintenance Mode</A></H2>

    Bring server into and out of the maintenance mode
<BR>
    In maintenance mode, only requests from maintenance users are served
<BR>
    Useful if you want to restart services or change the server settings
    and want to avoid web-access during this time (especially if the configuration
    is in a non-consistent state for some time period).
<BR>
    All requests from other useres will get a "maintenance mode - retry later" response.


<HR>


<H2><A NAME="START" HREF="#INDEX">Start Server</A></H2>

    Starts the servers service process.


<H2><A NAME="STOP" HREF="#INDEX">Stop Server</A></H2>

    Stops the server (soft stop).
<BR>
    No new incoming connection requests are served,
    and no new requests on kept-alive connections are handled.
<BR>
    All ongoing request processing
    is finished and the requests are answered.
<BR>
    When all ongoing requests have been answered,
    the servers service process is finally terminated,
    and the accepting socket (server port) is closed.

<H2><A NAME="HARD_TERMINATE" HREF="#INDEX">Hard Terminate Server</A></H2>

    Hard terminate the server
<P>
    Immediately terminates any server activity (without giving ongoing requests
    a change of being finished), stop the processes and close the server socket.
<BR>
    Useful if the server hangs on a request or entered some fatal error condition
    (typically, due to software bugs ;-) so that a soft stop does not work.


<H2><A NAME="REMOVE" HREF="#INDEX">Remove Server</A></H2>

    Remove the server from settings dialog.
    This frees all configuration and data objects associated to that server.


<HR>

<H2><A NAME="SAVE_SETTINGS" HREF="#INDEX">Save Settings to File...</A></H2>

    Save all the server settings into a file.
<BR>
    Useful if you want remember the configuration of a server
    or to create a settings file for a <A HREF="standaloneApplication.html">standalone webServer</A>.


<H2><A NAME="LOAD_SETTINGS" HREF="#INDEX">Load Settings from File...</A></H2>

    Load all settings for this webServer from a previously saved settings file.


<H2><A NAME="REMOVE_SETTINGS" HREF="#INDEX">Remove Settings File...</A></H2>

    Remove a settings file from file system.
