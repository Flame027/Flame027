Examples on how to create, link, load and call C-functions
contained in an external shared library.

Type make (bmake / vcmake / mingwmake) here to generate 4 files:

	stx_doc_coding_cModules.dll
		a dll containing Smalltalk code,
		which loads and calls the C libraries

	demoCLib1.dll
		a dll containing C code,

	demoCLib2.dll
		a dll containing C code and initializer functions,

	demoCLib3.dll
		a dll containing C code and initializer functions,

Then, in Smalltalk load the smalltalk class library with:
	Smalltalk loadPackage:'stx:doc/coding/cModules'

and open a browser on the CModuleDemo class.
	CodingExamples::CModuleDemo class browse

There. try the three examples: demo1, demo2 and demo3
Each will load the corresponding C-library, call a function and then unload the dll.
