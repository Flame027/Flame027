Here, you find demos related to more tricky C-Function interfacing,
demonstrating the use of callBacks and timers.
(i.e. non-direct function calling)


The classes contained here must be stc-compiled;
you cannot simply fileIn the source.

before loading, execute:
	make CTimer.o
	(on ELF-based systems:
	    make CTimer.o; make CTimer.so)

then,
fileIn the resulting class object file.
