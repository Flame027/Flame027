This directory contains the high level graphical development tools. 
They are compiled by stc into the library 'libtool'. 

These are normally not needed for final applications -
actually, if you are producing an end-user application, you
are NOT allowed to include the Browser and other development
tools in that executable - except if the end-user has a developpers
licence too.

Use of these classes requires that 'libview', 'libview2', 'libwidg' and
'libwidg2' are also loaded into the system.
(although autoloading them is also possible).

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

	libtool.a      - an archive

	libtool.obj    - a prelinked object library

	libtool.so     - a shared object

the library includes init code (libtool_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libwidg

    make objs           compile all object files

    make install        compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall       only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date 

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate

    make clean

    make clobber
