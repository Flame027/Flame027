This directory contains resource files for the tools.
These files are normally copied or sym-linked to a standard
place (like '/usr/local/lib/smalltalk/resources').

The tools get their strings from these resource files.

If you change anything here, make sure to do a 'make newResources'
in the directory '../smalltalk' and - if appropriate reinstall
the resource files into their standard place.

Notice: in ST/X above vsn 2.10.2, all style relevant stuff has
	been removed from the resource files into separate style
	sheets. Resourcefiles now only contain string translations.
