This directory contains resource files for some language specifics.
These files are normally copied or sym-linked to a standard
place (like '/usr/local/lib/smalltalk/resources').

The only class using resources is (currently) Date, which needs language
specific day- and month names.

If you change anything here, make sure to do a 'make newResources'
in the directory '../smalltalk' and - if appropriate reinstall
the resource files into their standard place.
