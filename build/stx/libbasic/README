This directory contains (what we consider) fundamental
classes required for any serious Smalltalk application
(both headless and GUI-based).

Of course, for special applications, even this set of
classes could be reduced 
(for smaller apps, some of LargeInteger, Float, Fraction 
 etc. could be left out).

We do not provide tools or support for such minimal 
configurations - with modern, paged OperatingSystems, there
is also less sense in doing so, since unused code is simply
paged out or never paged in at all.
