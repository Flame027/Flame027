This directory contains the basic classes. 
They are compiled by stc into the library 'libbasic' to be
linked to your application. It is also needed to build a complete 
smalltalk (the one you're currently in).

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

	libbasic.a	- an archive

	libbasic.obj	- a prelinked object library

	libbasic.so	- a shared object

the library includes init code (libbasic_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libbasic

    make objs           compile all object files

    make install	compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall	only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate

    make <file>.chk     run syntax check on <file>.st

    make clean		clean individual .o-files; leave library

    make clobber	clean everything
