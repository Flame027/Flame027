documentation
"
    In the SunRPC nameSpace, you will find the framework for Sun (ONC-) RPCs,
    an rpcgen-like idl parser, RPCServer and RPCClient baseclasses,
    and sample implementations for PortMapperClient, MountServer, MountClient
    and NFSServer.

    The coolest program there is the NFS interface to smalltalk/X - see the
    examples and documentation in MountServer for more info.
