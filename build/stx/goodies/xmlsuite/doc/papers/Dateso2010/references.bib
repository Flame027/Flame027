  Title          = {Towards a Taxonomy of {SUnit} Tests},
  BookTitle      = {Proceedings of 13th International Smalltalk Conference
                   (ISC'03)},
  abstract       = {Not all unit tests are alike. Some tests are simple
                   one-liners, while others contain a battery of
                   assertions. Certain tests focus on a single method,
                   while others test interactions between methods. There
                   are even tests that do not contain assertions at all.
                   This can make it difficult for a developer to
                   understand which methods are tested by which tests, to
                   what degree they are tested, and what to take into
                   account while refactoring. We have manually analyzed
                   the test base of a large existing object-oriented
                   system in order to derive a first taxonomy of unit
                   tests. We have then developed some simple tools to
                   semi-automatically categorize tests according to this
                   taxonomy, and applied it to two case studies. Beside
                   explaining our taxonomy, we report on our initial
                   results using it, namely that a majority of unit tests
                   focus on single methods and that our lightweight
                   automatic categorization could already classify more
                   than 50\% of these single method commands.},

                   manipulating hierarchically complex objects, which
                   covers an extended object model and an object-centered
                   query algebra. Extensions of the object model are
                   mainly based on a separation of structural and semantic
                   elements in modeling complex objects, including a
                   general distinction between aggregation reference and
                   association reference, and introduction of type
                   inheritance into aggregation hierarchies and a support
                   for combination of aggregation inheritance with subtype
                   inheritance. Based on the extensions, we develop a
                   query algebra as an integral part of the model. Unlike
                   most of existing algebra-based query languages, our
                   object algebra takes complex object collectively as a
                   unit of high level queries and allows complex objects
                   to be accessed at all levels of aggregation hierarchies
                   without having resort to any king of path expressions.
                   Features of aggregation hierarchies, such as acyclicity
                   and aggregation inheritance, have played important
                   roles in such a development. We have also formally
                   described the output type of each operator in order for
                   dynamic classification of query results in the IsA
                   type/class lattice. Although the design is based on the
                   chosen object-oriented model, other object-oriented
                   databases are possible. We feel that the proposal
                   largely covers the query requirements for complex
                   objects, and meanwhile provides users with an
                   opportunity to remain within the framework of the model
                   of complex objects while querying database. As a
                   consequence, the flexibility and adaptability of the
                   object-oriented model against schema changes are
                   increased.},

  Pages          = {35-44},
  abstract       = {Stevens, Myers, and Constantine introduced the notion
                   of cohesion, an ordinal scale of seven levels that
                   describes the degree to which the actions performed by
                   a module contribute to a unified function [12]. They
                   provided rules, termed as `associative principles' to
                   examine the relationships between `processing elements'
                   of a module and designate a cohesion level to it.
                   Stevens et. al., however, did not give a precise
                   definition for the term `processing element', thereby
                   leaving it open for interpretations.This paper
                   interprets the `output variables' (not statements) of a
                   module as its processing elements. Stevens et. al.'s
                   associative principles are transformed to relate the
                   output variables based on their `data' and `control
                   dependence' relationships. What results is a rule-based
                   approach to computing cohesion. Experimental results
                   show that, but for temporal cohesion, the cohesion
                   associated to a module under our reinterpretation and
                   that due to the original Definitions are identical for
                   all examples. },

                   computational system. For example, a program in Prolog
                   can reason about a program written in Smalltalk.
                   Reflection is a more powerful form of meta programming
                   where the same language is used to reason about, and
                   act upon, itself in a causally connected way. Thus on
                   the one hand we have meta programming that allows
                   different languages or paradigms to be used, but
                   without causal connection, while on the other hand we
                   have reflection that offers causal connection but only
                   for a single language. This paper combines both and
                   presents inter-language reflection that allows one
                   language to reason about and change in a causally
                   connected way another language and vice versa. The
                   fundamental aspects of inter-language reflection and
                   the language symbiosis used therein, are discussed.
                   Moreover the implementation of two symbiotic reflective
                   languages is discussed: Agora/Java and SOUL/Smalltalk.},

                   TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION within an software engineering
                   process. The characteristics of technical documentation
                   and its behaviour within an dynamic software
                   development environment are important to understand the
                   problems that occur with technical documentation. I
                   explore the factors that influence the development and
                   the resulting quality of the technical docu-mentation.
                   The RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE AND
                   TECHNICAL DOC-UMENTATION is used to coordinate the
                   development of the technical documentation with the
                   software development. The principle to match software
                   entity names with documentation segments defines the
                   relationship between software and documenta-tion. I
                   demonstrate how it works and how it is used for
                   coordination of the software development and the
                   technical documentation development. An analysis of
                   different name representations and documentation
                   segmentation structures shows the influence of the
                   structures on the creation of relations. I explore
                   under which conditions relations are generated that fit
                   best to the relationship between software and
                   documentation that exists in reality. The ASSOCIATIVE
                   DOCUMENTATION MODEL (ADM) builds on the relationship
                   between software and documentation that is determined
                   by matching of software en-tity names within
                   documentation. The ADM focuses on three aspects: It
                   concentrates on the extraction of the names of software
                   entities. ADM uses Famix models that are capable to
                   represent any object-oriented software and detects the
                   software entities to be represented by their names.
                   Additionally, ADM considers structural relationships
                   between the software entities that are given by
                   inheritance, aggregation, invocation and access. The
                   second aspect is the representation of the relationship
                   between software and documentation. Especially the
                   influence of the inner relationship of software
                   en-tities on the relationship between software and
                   documentation is important. The third aspect is to get
                   the detection of the software entity names and the
                   generation of the relationship between software and
                   documentation into a consistent model. It serves as a
                   uniform model of the software-documentation
                   relationship for any application that uses this model.
                   CHANGE IMPACT DETECTION is an sample application of the
                   ADM. It determines changes between two software
                   versions by comparison of the models of these versions.
                   Differences between the models are interpreted as
                   changes. The names of the entities that are affected by
                   the changes are taken as representations of the
                   changes. The ADM relates these change representations
                   to the documentation. This way, impact of the software
                   changes on the documentation is detected over the ADM
                   relations. The func-tionality and usage as well as the

  abstract       = {Although object-oriented languages are well-suited to
                   implementing software components, they fail to shine in
                   the construction of component-based applications,
                   largely because object-oriented design tends to obscure
                   a component-based architecture. We propose to tackle
                   this problem by clearly separating component
                   implementation and composition. Piccola is a small
                   "composition language" that embodies the paradigm of
                   "applications = components + scripts." Piccola models
                   components and composition abstractions by means of a
                   unifying foundation of communicating concurrent agents.
                   Flexibility and extensibility are obtained by modelling
                   both interfaces to components and the contexts in which
                   they live by extensible records, or "forms". We
                   illustrate the realization of an architectural style in
                   Piccola and show how external components may be adapted
                   and composed according to the style. We show how
                   separating components from their composition can
                   improve maintainability.},

                   application (in the area of Molecular Dynamics
                   Simulation) modelled in a concurrent object-oriented
                   language. In this computational model, application
                   objects can exhibit some autonomous behaviour and
                   reside in a global object space. At runtime, this
                   object space can physically be mapped on a distributed
                   memory machine. The case study indicates the pitfalls
                   of pure name-based object interaction. We show that due
                   to the dynamic nature of the interaction schemes
                   between the application objects, coordination
                   primitives are necessary to achieve expressive lucidity
                   within a programming language. As a result, two kinds
                   of semantics exist for coordination in the object
                   space: 1. Sender-initiated coordination by means of
                   pattern-based group communication. 2.
                   Receiver-initiated coordination by means of
                   multi-object synchronisation constraints. A language
                   framework is proposed that enables a programmer to
                   express both kinds of coordination, and a concise
                   implementation based on a meta-level architecture is
                   presented.},

  abstract       = {Seaside is a framework for developing sophisticated
                   web applications in Smalltalk. One thing missing until
                   now has been a way to automatically test the running
                   applications in a web browser. We could open a browser
                   and test some scenarios by hand. This is not very
                   effective for larger applications and for regression
                   testing though, so we need a way to write automatic
                   tests for our web applications. Albatross is the key to
                   this problem, because it allows us to write tests
                   directly in Smalltalk using the unit testing framework.
                   It opens the web application in an external web browser
                   and simulates user interactions. It provides access to
                   the running and rendered web application and at the
                   same time to the model of your application. There is
                   even no need of bothering with HTML tags and ids,
                   because Albatross has cleverer ways to find out what to
                   do. It finds form fields just by identifying the
                   corresponding label text or clicks on links just by
                   locating the displayed link text.},

                   combination mechanism with block structure propagation.
                   Traditionally, mixins can be composed to form new
                   classes, possibly merging the implementations of
                   methods (as in CLOS). In our approach, a class or
                   method combination operation may cause any number of
                   implicit combinations. For example, it is possible to
                   specify separate aspects of a family of classes, and
                   then combine several aspects into a full-fledged class
                   family. The combination expressions would explicitly
                   combine whole-family aspects, and by propagation
                   implicitly combine the aspects for each member of the
                   class family, and again by propagation implicitly
                   compose each method from its aspects. As opposed to
                   CLOS, this is type-checked statically; and as opposed
                   to other systems for advanced class
                   combination/merging/weaving, it is integrated directly
                   in the language, ensuring a clear semantics and a
                   seamless interaction with the type system. Moreover,
                   the basic mechanism used in the combination,
                   linearization, is formalized and generalized compared
                   to previous presentions.},

                   allows processes to communicate without knowing each
                   other's identities and without having to arrange for a
                   definite rendezvous. This high level of abstraction
                   would make Linda particularly suitable for use as a
                   coordination model for open systems, if it were not for
                   the fact that the Linda communication is very unsafe.
                   We propose to remove this deficiency of Linda by means
                   of the concept of law-governed architecture previously
                   applied to centralized and message passing systems. We
                   define a model for Law-Governed Linda (LGL)
                   communication, and we demonstrate its efficacy by means

  abstract       = {Recovering the architecture is the first step towards
                   reengineering a software system. Many reverse
                   engineering tools use top-down exploration as a way of
                   providing a visual and interactive process for
                   architecture recovery. During the exploration process,
                   the user navigates through various views on the system
                   by choosing from several exploration operations.
                   Although some sequences of these operations lead to
                   views which, from the architectural point of view, are
                   mode relevant than others, current tools do not provide
                   a way of predicting which exploration paths are worth
                   taking and which are not. In this article we propose a
                   set of package patterns which are used for augmenting
                   the exploration process with in formation about the
                   worthiness of the various exploration paths. The
                   patterns are defined based on the internal package
                   structure and on the relationships between the package
                   and the other packages in the system. To validate our
                   approach, we verify the relevance of the proposed
                   patterns for real-world systems by analyzing their
                   frequency of occurrence in six open-source software
                   projects.},

                   applications can be attributed to our disposition to
                   build systems largely from scratch. An application
                   development support system would shift the emphasis
                   from programming of arbitrary systems to {\it
                   configuration} of certain classes of applications from
                   pre-packaged software. In order for this style of
                   application development to be successful, we argue that
                   it should be carried out in an object-oriented software
                   environment. Such an environment would consist of an
                   object-oriented language and system that integrates
                   various object-oriented approaches, user interface
                   tools for monitoring and interacting with active

  abstract       = {Although unit testing is essential for programming,
                   current languages only barely support the developer in
                   composing unit tests into new ones or in navigating
                   between unit tests and their corresponding methods
                   under test. We have taken several Smalltalk programs
                   and analyzed the relationships between unit tests and
                   methods under test, and the re- lationships amongst
                   unit tests. First results indicate that most unit tests
                   can be seen or at least decomposed into commands which
                   focus on single methods, and that large portions of
                   unit tests overlap each other. But these relationships
                   between unit tests and methods under test are not
                   reflected in current languages. We therefore first
                   conceptually extend the meta-model of Smalltalk with
                   one-method commands so that unit tests become both com-
                   posable and navigable. Then we introduce a first
                   lightweight implementation of this meta model using
                   method comments to differentiate between the several
                   test phases of existing XUnit test case methods.},

                   are easier and safer to use than conventional external
                   iterators, it is commonly assumed that they are not
                   applicable in languages without builtin support for
                   closures and that they are less flexible than external
                   iterators. We present an iteration framework that uses
                   objects to emulate closures, separates structure
                   exploration and data consumption, and generalizes on
                   folding, thereby invalidating both the above
                   statements. Our proposed "transfold" scheme allows
                   processing one or more data structures simultaneously
                   without exposing structure representations and without
                   writing explicit loops. We show that the use of two
                   functional concepts (function parameterization and lazy
                   evaluation) within an object-oriented language allows
                   combining the safety and economic usage of internal
                   iteration with the flexibility and client control of
                   external iteration. Sample code is provided using the

  abstract       = {Previous work on type-theoretic foundations for
                   object-oriented programming languages has mostly
                   focused on applying or extending functional type theory
                   to functional "objects." This approach, while
                   benefiting from a vast body of existing literature, has
                   the disadvantage of dealing with state change either in
                   a roundabout way or not at all, and completely
                   sidestepping issues of concurrency. In particular,
                   dynamic issues of non-uniform service availability and
                   conformance to protocols are not addressed by
                   functional types. We propose a new type framework that
                   characterizes objects as regular (finite state)
                   processes that provide guarantees of service along
                   public channels. We also propose a new notion of
                   subtyping for active objects, based on Brinksma's
                   notion of extension, that extends Wegner and Zdonik's
                   "principle of substitutability" to non-uniform service
                   availability. Finally, we formalize what it means to
                   "satisfy a client's expectations," and we show how
                   regular types can be used to tell when sequential or
                   concurrent clients are satisfied.},

                   tool for exploring mathematically-based interactions
                   which produce complex motions for computer animation.
                   The tool has been implemented as a class in the
                   object-oriented computer animation system The
                   Clockworks. It supports the definition of complex
                   interactions between geometric objects through the
                   specification of messages to the interacting objects.
                   Our approach is general, flexible and powerful. The
                   tool itself is not hardcoded to a particular
                   application. It simply sends the messages specified by
                   the user. Messages are specified as strings which may
                   be stored, modified and interpreted. Since the tool is
                   part of The Clockworks it may utilize many of the
                   powerful features of the system, including data
                   structuring, mathematical, geometric modeling, and
                   rendering objects. The tool has been used to explore a
                   general spring and mass model, and the response of
                   objects in a vector field.},

                   crucial to know their architecture. The first problem
                   is that unlike classes and packages, architecture is
                   not explicitly represented in the code. The second
                   problem is that successful applications evolve over
                   time, so their architecture inevitably drifts.
                   Reconstructing the architecture and checking whether it
                   is still valid is therefore an important aid. While
                   there is a plethora of approaches and techniques
                   supporting architecture reconstruction, there is no
                   comprehensive state of the art and it is often
                   difficult to compare the approaches. This article

                   the design of a obc model compatible with the
                   mechanisms of object-oriented programming. We propose
                   an approach to language design in which an executable
                   notation describing the behaviour of communicating
                   agents is extended by syntactic patterns that
                   encapsulate language constructs. We indicate how
                   various language models can be accommodated, and how
                   mechanisms such as inheritance can be modeled. Finally,
                   we introduce a new notion of types that characterizes
                   concurrent objects in terms of their externally visible
                   behaviour.},

  Institution    = {vub},
  abstract       = {Hypermedia technology is a potential benefit for all
                   computer applications that deal with information. To
                   penetrate new markets, hypermedia systems should be
                   tailorable to specific application domains. We claim
                   that an open, extensible hypermedia system is crucial
                   to attain such tailorability. A hypermedia system
                   should be capable to integrate 1) facilities for
                   incorporating vendor-independent document viewers and
                   2) flexible linking facilities that access external
                   information repositories. This document describes how
                   we extended the Dexter model with the "path" concept,
                   to model hypermedia systems with extensible link
                   engines. We show that paths absorb the notion of links
                   and make it possible to integrate various strategies
                   for resolving links. This proves our claim that "paths
                   end the tyranny of the link". This is demonstrated with
                   a case from the Software Engineering Community: a
                   framework browser. The case involves a hypermedia
                   system that integrates a home-cooked world-wide web
                   browser, an off-the-shelf word processor (Microsoft
                   Word) and a programming environment for Smalltalk
                   (VisualWorks). Besides interpreting embedded (HTML
                   style) anchors, the system is able to query the
                   Smalltalk environment to link documentation to
                   Smalltalk source code. The case serves as a proof of
                   concept that an extensible hypermedia system can
                   penetrate specific application domains.},

  abstract       = {Smalltalk is not only an object-oriented programming
                   language; it is also known for its extensive integrated
                   development environment supporting interactive and
                   dynamic programming. While the default tools are
                   adequate for browsing the code and developing
                   applications, it is often cumbersome to extend the
                   environment to support new language constructs or to
                   build additional tools supporting new ways of
                   navigating and presenting source code. In this paper,
                   we present the OmniBrowser, a browser framework that
                   supports the definition of browsers based on an
                   explicit metamodel. With OmniBrowser a domain model is
                   described in a graph and the navigation in this graph
                   is specified in its associated metagraph. We present
                   how new browsers are built from predefined parts and
                   how new tools are easily described. The browser
                   framework is implemented in the Squeak Smalltalk
                   environment. This paper shows several concrete
                   instantiations of the framework: a remake of the
                   ubiquitous Smalltalk System Browser, a coverage
                   browser, the Duo Browser and the Dynamic Protocols

  abstract       = {The developers of tools for dynamic analysis are faced
                   with choosing from the many approaches to gathering
                   runtime data. Typically, dynamic analysis involves
                   instrumenting the program under investigation to record
                   its runtime behavior. Current approaches for byte-code
                   based systems like Java and Smalltalk rely often on
                   inserting byte-code into the program under analysis.
                   However, detailed knowledge of the target programming
                   language or virtual machine is required to implement
                   dynamic analysis tools. Obtaining and exploiting this
                   knowledge to build better analysis tools is cumbersome
                   and often distracts the tool builder from the actual
                   goal, which is the analysis of the runtime behavior of
                   a system. In this paper, we argue that we need to adopt
                   a higher level view of a software system when
                   considering the task of abstracting runtime
                   information. We focus on object-oriented virtual
                   machine based languages. We want to be able to deal
                   with the runtime system as a collection of reified
                   first-class entities. We propose to achieve this by
                   introducing a layer of abstraction, i.e., a behavioral
                   middle layer. This has the advantage that the task of
                   collecting dynamic information is not concerned with
                   low level details of a specific language or virtual
                   machine. The positive effect of such a behavioral
                   middle layer is twofold: on the one hand it provides us
                   with a standard API for all dynamic analysis based
                   tools to use, on the other hand it allows the tool
                   developer to abstract from the actual implementation
                   technique.},

                   functions to produce complex motions. Cost functions
                   can be used to define goal-oriented motions and
                   actions. A cost function can be defined whose variables
                   are the animated parameters of a scene. The parameters
                   are modified in such a way to minimize the cost
                   function. The minimum cost configuration can be viewed
                   as a "key goal" configuration. The values of the
                   parameters are stored at certain intervals during the
                   minimization process. This produces a path through the
                   parameter space of the model being animated. By
                   incrementally moving along the parameter space curve
                   and updating the model defined by the parameters, an
                   animation of the model performing a goal-oriented
                   action may be produced. A class has been created and

                   \fIinstance adaptation\fP for centralized and
                   distributed object-oriented database systems. Our
                   evolution support scheme is distinguished from previous
                   mechanisms in that it is primarily concerned with
                   preserving existing database objects and maintaining
                   compatibility for old applications, while permitting a
                   wider range of evolution operations. It achieves this
                   by supporting schema versioning, allowing multiple
                   representations of instances to persist simultaneously,
                   and providing for programmer specification of how to
                   adapt existing instances. The mechanism is general

                   support the design of development environments and to
                   extend languages. However, the granularity of
                   structural reflection stops at the method level. This
                   is a problem since without sub-method reflection
                   developers have to duplicate efforts, for example to
                   introduce transparently pluggable type-checkers or
                   fine-grained profilers. In this paper we present
                   Persephone, an efficient implementation of a sub-method
                   meta-object protocol (MOP) based on AST annotations and
                   dual methods (a compiled method and its meta-object)
                   that reconcile AST expressiveness with bytecode
                   execution. We validate the MOP by presenting TreeNurse,
                   a method instrumentation framework and TypePlug, an
                   optional, pluggable type system which is based on
                   Persephone.},

                   with object-oriented features such as attributes and
                   methods in the presence of subtyping. The general
                   (typed) set constructs of FM allow one to deal with
                   (database) constraints in TM. The paper describes the
                   theory of FM, and discusses the role that set
                   expressions may play in conceptual database schemas.
                   Special attention is paid to the treatment of
                   constraints, and a three-step specification approach is
                   proposed. This approach results in the formal notion of

                   development of applications but do not offer the
                   ability to add or replace a method in a class that is
                   not defined in that module. On the other hand,
                   languages that support method addition and replacement
                   do not provide a modular view of applications, and
                   their changes have a global impact. The result is a gap
                   between module systems for object-oriented languages on
                   one hand, and the very desirable feature of method
                   addition and replacement on the other hand. To solve
                   these problems we present classboxes, a module system
                   for object-oriented languages that provides method
                   addition and replacement. Moreover, the changes made by
                   a classbox are only visible to that classbox (or
                   classboxes that import it), a feature we call local
                   rebinding. To validate the model, we have implemented
                   it in the Squeak Smalltalk environment, and performed
                   experiments modularising code. },

                   engineering techniques attempt to reconstruct software
                   models from source code with the help of a parser for
                   the source language. Unfortunately a great deal of
                   effort may be required to build a specialized parser
                   for a legacy programming language or dialect. On the
                   other hand, (i) we typically do not need a complete
                   parser that recognizes all language constructs, and
                   (ii) we have a rich supply of (legacy) examples. We
                   present an approach to use these facts to rapidly and
                   incrementally develop parsers as follows: we specify
                   mappings from source code examples to model elements;
                   we use the mappings to generate a parser; we parse as
                   much code as we can; we use the exceptional cases to
                   develop new example mappings; and we iterate.
                   Experiments with Java and Ruby, two very different
                   languages, suggest that our approach can be a very
                   efficient and effective way to rapidly construct

                   Smalltalk itself with ease. However, such an addition
                   would short-change the powerful dynamic aspects of
                   Smalltalk. In this article we present SmallInterfaces;
                   a new ontology of dynamic i nterfaces which makes a
                   powerful use of the dynamic nature of Smalltalk.
                   SmallInterfaces adds interfaces as honorary members to
                   Smalltalk's extensive reflection mechanism, in a manner
                   portable across the many Smalltalk variants},

                   system. A few primitives permit the programmer to take
                   full advantage of distribution and to tune performance;
                   most notably by restricting the mobility of objects and
                   specifying which objects should move together. This
                   paper describes the implementation of these extensions:
                   the object format, communication system and the
                   mechanism to invoke operations on remote objects.
                   Performance figures are also presented. },

                   Understanding dynamic behavior through event analysis
                   is a challenge because of the large amount of data

                   collaborations and roles is now well accepted.
                   Collaboration-based or role-based designs decompose an
                   application into tasks performed by a subset of the
                   applications' classes. Collaborations prov ide a larger
                   unit of understanding and reuse than classes, and are
                   an important aid in the maintenance and evolution of
                   the software. This kind of design information is lost,
                   however, at the implementation level, making it hard to
                   maintain and evolve an e xisting software application.
                   The extraction of collaborations from code is therefore
                   an important issue in design recovery. In this paper we
                   propose an iterative approach which uses dynamic
                   information to support the recovery and understanding
                   of collabo rations. We describe a tool we have
                   developed to support our approach and demonstrate its

  abstract       = {We have investigated software development for open
                   distributed systems in order to make this development
                   easier. Easier in the sense that software parts will be
                   better reusable, more flexible and better maintainable.
                   The hardest part is to address evolution of these
                   systems because not all application requirements can be
                   known in advance. In particular we have investigated
                   the coordination aspects of open distributed systems.
                   Coordination technology addresses the management of
                   interaction of software agents in a distributed or
                   parallel environment and, therefore, typically
                   describes architectural aspects of a system. To reach
                   the goal of easier software development we have applied
                   a component oriented approach: generic coordination
                   solutions are provided as generic architectures with
                   black box components. Applications are constructed
                   using these architectures and composing and
                   parameterizing these generic components. In this way we
                   make the interaction part of a system reusable and
                   flexible. The architecture of the system is also made
                   clearer and therefore easier understandable. A
                   prototype coordination framework and a set of sample
                   applications that are representative for open
                   distributed systems and that use this framework, have
                   been developed in the concurrent object-oriented
                   programming language {Java}. We show that, using our
                   component-oriented approach, we gain reusability,
                   flexibility and provide clear architectures of
                   applications. A major problem, however, concerning the
                   genericity of components, is the application dependent
                   information that may be needed by a coordination
                   solution: the genericity of the solution is strongly
                   dependent on the possibility to separate this
                   information from the generic solution.},

                   Approach},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {The reality of software development is such that
                   engineers must often perform maintenance tasks with
                   missing or out-of-date documentation and without the
                   support of the original developers. To understand the
                   software as it is now, engineers use reverse
                   engineering tools to recover information from the code
                   itself. Most such tools analyze only static information
                   about the system and so provide engineers with
                   structural, rather than behavioral models. It is,
                   however, critical to understand the behavioral aspect
                   of the software system in order to carry out certain
                   maintenance tasks. To better understand program
                   behavior engineers turn to tools which use dynamic
                   information collected during program execution. Such
                   tools typically display all the dynamic information at
                   very fine granularity, making it difficult to extract
                   manageable models of behavior. They then rely on
                   visualization and navigation techniques to help the
                   engineer locate information relevant to the change
                   task. In this dissertation we propose an approach to
                   recovering behavioral models from object-oriented
                   software which is based on perspectives. Our approach
                   enables an engineer to declaratively define
                   perspectives through which the dynamic information can
                   be viewed. It supports an iterative recovery process in
                   which successive views of the software system help the
                   engineer to answer questions related to the maintenance
                   task to be performed. We claim that such an approach
                   can overcome the difficulties of recovering succinct
                   and focused views of object-oriented software from
                   dynamic information. A perspective is a model of the
                   kind of information that an engineer is interested in.
                   Our approach supports the construction of principally
                   two kinds of such models: component-connector models
                   and collaboration models. We first identify a
                   meta-model for describing object-oriented software and
                   its execution, then develop a simple declarative way to
                   express perspectives in terms of this meta-model:
                   component-connector perspectives express a range of
                   static groupings and dynamic relations; collaboration
                   perspectives abstract from execution sequences to class
                   collaborations. Using case studies we demonstrate the
                   validity of our approach by showing how perspectives
                   are used in an iterative process to recover both
                   high-level and low-level succinct behavioral views.},

  abstract       = {The maintenance, reengineering, and evolution of
                   object-oriented software systems has become a vital
                   matter in today's software industry. Although most
                   systems start off in a clean and well-designed state,
                   with time they tend to gradually decay in quality,
                   unless the systems are reengineered and adapted to the
                   evolving requirements. However, before such legacy
                   software systems can be reengineered and evolved, they
                   must be reverse engineered, i.e., their structure and
                   inner working must b e understood. This is difficult
                   because of several factors, such as the sheer size of
                   the systems, their complexity, their domain
                   specificity, and in general the bad state legacy
                   software systems are in. In this thesis we propose a
                   visual approach to the reverse engineering of
                   object-oriented software systems by means of polymetric
                   views, lightweight visualizations of software enriched
                   with metrics and other types of semantic information
                   about the software, e.g., its age, version,
                   abstractness, location, structure, function, etc. We
                   present and discuss several polymetric views which
                   allow us to understand three different aspects of
                   object-oriented software, namely (1) coarse-grained
                   aspects which allow for the understanding of very large
                   systems, (2) fine -grained aspects which allow for the
                   understanding of classes and class hierarchies, and (3)
                   evolutionary aspects, which enable us to recover and
                   understand the evolution of a software system. The
                   combination of these three types of information can
                   greatly reduce the time needed to gain an understanding
                   of an object-oriented software system. Based on the
                   application of our polymetric views, we present our
                   reverse engineering methodology which we validated and
                   refined on several occasions in industrial set tings.
                   It allows us to explore and combine these three
                   approaches into one single visual approach to
                   understand software.},

                   No model, including our CoLaS coordination model,

                   In order to try to provide an answer, in particular for
                   the CoLaS model, we propose in this paper OpenCoLaS, a

                   these abstractions to some underlying implementation.
                   Still, all cur-rent tools are based on generating
                   source code in which the design patterns become
                   implicit. After that, further extension and adaptation
                   of the software is needed but this can no longer be
                   supported at the same level of abstraction. This paper
                   presents FACE, an environment based on an explicit
                   representa-tion of design patterns, sustaining an
                   incremental development style without abandoning the

                   characteristics. This paper proposes a scripting
                   facility to help program such applications. This
                   facility provides support for specifying long-term
                   behaviour of objects in an object-oriented environment.
                   Temporal scripts can instantiated and combined using a
                   set of temporal operators, saying for example that two
                   activities begin at the same time, or that one has to
                   follow the other. Through a flexible sampling policy
                   based on a notion of virtual time, temporal
                   specifications can he executed at various temporal
                   resolutions, and therefore can be reused indifferent

  abstract       = {Data visualization is the process of representing data
                   as pictures to support reasoning about the underlying
                   data. For the interpretation to be as easy as possible,
                   we need to be as close as possible to the original
                   data. As most visualization tools have an internal
                   meta-model, which is different from the one for the
                   presented data, they usually need to duplicate the
                   original data to conform to their meta-model. This
                   leads to an increase in the resources needed, increase
                   which is not always justified. In this work we argue
                   for the need of having an engine that is as close as
                   possible to the data and we present our solution of
                   moving the visualization tool to the data, instead of
                   moving the data to the visualization tool. Our solution
                   also emphasizes the necessity of reusing basic blocks
                   to express complex visualizations and allowing the
                   programmer to script the visualization using his
                   preferred tools, rather than a third party format. As a
                   validation of the expressiveness of our framework, we
                   show how we express several already published
                   visualizations and describe the pros and cons of the
                   approach.},

  abstract       = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that
                   aims at improving software modularization. Indeed,
                   aspects are yet another dimension for structuring
                   applications. The notion of aspect refers to any
                   cross-cuting property. This definition encompasses both
                   functional (business) and non-functional
                   (infrastructure) properties. However, most approaches
                   for AOP focus on only one category of aspects: either
                   functional aspects or non-functional ones. This paper
                   aims at bridging the gap between those two families. We
                   present a solution for describing both functional and
                   non-functional aspects in a uniform fashion. This
                   solution relies on reflection and mixin-based
                   inheritance.},

                   application are presented, based on the assumption that
                   static and behavioral properties have been described
                   within some object-oriented model. These techniques
                   enable the specification of the dynamic evolution of
                   object behavior and the interactions of collections of
                   cooperating objects. The underlying formalism used for
                   our specifications is the language of first-order
                   temporal logic. A method for checking consistency of
                   specifications is also presented.},

                   program to evaluate the sediment delivery in mountain
                   torrents. The program is written in SuperWaba, an open
                   source programming language which is similar to Java,
                   but specially developed for PDA devices. Using this
                   programming language, it was possible to develop a
                   program running on Palm OS as well as under Windows CE.
                   SEDEX itself is a tool to estimate the sediment
                   delivery of a mountain torrent in case of a flood or a
                   debris flow. It shall help specialists to make their
                   analysis more efficient and to get a more transparent
                   and traceable result which is, for example, used for
                   hazard maps. The tool is developed by the Institute for
                   Geography of the University of Bern in order of the
                   Civil Engineering Office of the canton of Bern. The PDA
                   software was developed at the Institute of Computer
                   Science and Applied Mathematics of the University of
                   Bern as a project in computer science with the
                   Institute for Geography as costumer. This document
                   shall give an overview on the developing process
                   including the project requirements. Furthermore, a
                   technical manual and a user handbook is included into

  Title          = {Forms, Agents and Channels --- Defining Composition
                   Abstraction with Style},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {Object-oriented technology and design is not the final
                   answer to the recurrent problem of making systems, on
                   one hand, more open and flexible and, on the other
                   hand, more robust, safe, and fast. While
                   object-oriented languages have a lot of success in
                   implementing components, they have rather limited
                   support for expressing composition abstractions. As
                   such, the component-based software principle is only
                   partially supported by the object-oriented approach.
                   Component-based software development breaks down an
                   application into stable parts, i.e., the components,
                   and high-level abstractions for composing the
                   components. Flexibility is provided by the possibility
                   to recompose. How can we design a composition language
                   to support this metaphor? What mechanisms are needed to
                   encapsulate components, to make their contextual
                   assumptions explicit, and to define composition
                   abstractions in a compact way? We argue that we should
                   seek the minimal kernel of mechanisms that allows us to
                   define composition abstractions, instead of adding
                   additional language constructs to the object-oriented
                   paradigm. This is necessary in order to reason about
                   these abstractions and derive properties of the
                   composed application. In this thesis we propose Forms,
                   Agents and Channels as this minimal set of
                   abstractions. Forms are extensible records unified with
                   services. They are primitive objects, act as explicit
                   namespaces, and encapsulate arguments to invoke
                   services. Agents are autonomous entities that exchange
                   forms along channels. We show that this simple model is
                   expressive enough to define high-level composition
                   abstractions while being small enough to be
                   mathematically tractable. We present the formal model
                   of forms, agents and channels in terms of a composition
                   calculus. We encode the composition calculus into the
                   asynchronous pi-calculus and show the soundness of this
                   encoding. We define the composition language Piccola on
                   top of the composition calculus by adding some
                   syntactic sugar and by defining a bridge to access
                   external components. The usefulness of Piccola is
                   demonstrated by defining composition abstractions and
                   reasoning about them at the level of the language. We
                   present several kinds of composition abstractions:
                   wrappers to adapt components, connectors to implement
                   composition styles, and coordination abstractions that
                   cross-cut the functional decomposition of a system. We
                   also demonstrate how to reason about composition and
                   how to use glue code to detect and fix compositional
                   mismatches. },

                   traditionally been based on static type systems. As a
                   consequence, dynamically-typed languages have only
                   limited support for encapsulation. This is surprising,
                   considering that encapsulation is one of the most
                   fundamental and important concepts behind
                   object-oriented programming and that it is essential
                   for writing programs that are maintainable and
                   reliable, and that remain robust as they evolve. In
                   this paper we describe the problems that are caused by
                   insufficient encapsulation mechanisms and then present
                   object-oriented encapsulation, a simple and uniform
                   approach that solves these problems by bringing state
                   of the art encapsulation features to dynamically typed
                   languages. We provide a detailed discussion of our
                   design rationales and compare them and their
                   consequences to the encapsulation approaches used for
                   statically typed languages. We also describe an
                   implementation of object-oriented encapsulation in
                   Smalltalk. Benchmarks show that extensive use of
                   objectoriented encapsulation results in a slowdown of
                   less than 15 per cent.},

  abstract       = {When developing software systems, the relation between
                   design and implementation is typically left
                   unspecified. As a result design or implementation can
                   be modified independently of each other, and a
                   modification of either one does not lea ve any trace in
                   the other. The practical result of this is a number of
                   well-known problems such as drift and erosion,
                   documentation maintenance problems or round-trip
                   engineering trouble. To solve these problems we propose
                   to make the relation between des ign and implementation
                   explicit by expressing design as a logic meta program
                   over implementation. This is the cornerstone for
                   building a complete synchronisation framework that
                   allows one to synchronise changes to design and
                   implementation. We have implem ented such
                   synchronisation framework, and applied it successfully
                   on two case studies. },

                   the essential building blocks on top of which other
                   distribution related abstractions may be built. This
                   goal is made easier by demanding for type orthogonal
                   persistence and distribution as the full power of the
                   underlying language may then be used when building
                   higher level abstractions on top of the basic ones.},

                   object-oriented programming abstractions has suffered
                   from the inherent problem that reusability and
                   extensibility is limited due to position-dependent
                   parameters. To tackle this problem, we propose the
                   Form-calculus, an inherently polymorphic variant of the
                   Pi-calculus, where polyadic tuple communication is
                   replaced by monadic communication of extensible
                   records. This approach facilitates the specification of
                   flexible, concurrent, object-oriented programming
                   abstractions. Based on our previous work in this field,
                   we present a Form-calculus based meta-level approach
                   for concurrent, object-based programming which adapts a
                   compositional view of programming. This approach
                   enables the definition of various semantic models
                   supporting different kinds of inheritance and method
                   dispatch strategies, and clarifies concepts which are
                   typically merged in existing object-oriented
                   programming languages.},

                   implements many object-oriented features within a
                   conventional programming environment. The methodology
                   was created during the development of a computer
                   animation system, The Clockworks. The methodology
                   supports such object-oriented features as objects with
                   variables and methods, class hierarchies, variable and
                   method inheritance, object instantiation and message
                   passing. The methodology does not employ any special
                   keywords or language extensions; thus removing the need
                   for a preprocessor or compiler. The methodology has
                   been implemented in a C/Unix environment. This allows
                   the environment and any system developed within it to
                   be ported to a wide variety of computers which support
                   Unix. The methodology provides many object-oriented
                   features and associated benefits. It also provides all
                   of the benefits of a C/Unix environment including
                   portability, a rich variety of development tools, and
                   efficiency.},

                   a problematic one, especially from the functional
                   programming perspective. In this paper we discuss why
                   we believe explicit state is necessary for
                   general-purpose parallel programming, what features we
                   have adopted to support it, and (tentatively) when it
                   is appropriate to use stateful objects rather than a
                   purely functional representation. To provide some
                   context for the when discussion, we also review some of
                   the pure functional features of UFO, concentrating on
                   those aspects of the language which have evolved since
                   the original version. Finally, we look at how stateful
                   objects can be implemented efficiently. This has many
                   aspects; we focus on one, namely analysis to control
                   thread sizes, and present some preliminary results in
                   this area.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, we attempt to reveal the most essential
                   properties of distributed computations. We claim that
                   the notions of asynchrony, real-time, and autonomy are
                   vitally important to a widely distributed, open-ended,
                   ever-changing environment. We then propose a
                   programming language, called DROL, for asynchronous
                   real-time computing. It supports self-contained active
                   objects that have threads of control and a clock, and
                   introduces the notion of timed invocation, that
                   guarantees the survivability of each active object. We
                   place DROL as a first step in constructing programming
                   languages to realize the above three notions. We also
                   classify distributed computation into four forms
                   according to asynchrony and real-time properties, and
                   try to develop formalisms for the four categories based
                   on a process calculus. The formalisms allow us to
                   describe and analyze both globally and locally temporal
                   properties as well as the behavioral properties of
                   distributed objects and the interactions among them. We
                   discuss issues remaining to be solved and suggest some
                   possibilities for future work.},

  abstract       = {Successful software systems cope with complexity by
                   organizing classes into packages. However, a particular
                   organization may be neither straightforward nor obvious
                   for a given developer. As a consequence, classes can be
                   misplaced, leading to duplicated code and ripple
                   effects with minor changes effecting multiple packages.
                   We claim that contextual information is the key to
                   rearchitecture a system. Exploiting contextual
                   information, we propose a technique to detect misplaced
                   classes by analyzing how client packages access the
                   classes of a given provider package. We define locality
                   as a measure of the degree to which classes reused by
                   common clients appear in the same package. We then use
                   locality to guide a simulated annealing algorithm to
                   obtain optimal placements of classes in packages. The
                   result is the identification of classes that are
                   candidates for relocation. We apply the technique to
                   three applications and validate the usefulness of our
                   approach via developer interviews.},

                   of problems typically encountered in large-scale legacy
                   systems. Consequently, reverse engineering techniques
                   are relevant in an object-oriented context as well.
                   This paper investigates a hybrid approach, combining
                   the immediate appeal of visualisations with the
                   scalability of metrics. We validate such a hybrid
                   approach by showing how CodeCrawler ---the experimental
                   platform we built--- allowed us to understand the

  Title          = {Classboxes --- Controlling Visibility of Class
                   Extensions},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {Unanticipated changes to complex software systems can
                   introduce anomalies such as duplicated code, suboptimal
                   inheritance relationships and a proliferation of
                   run-time downcasts. Refactoring to eliminate these
                   anomalies may not be an option, at least in certain
                   stages of software evolution. A class extension is a
                   method that is defined in a module, but whose class is
                   defined elsewhere. Class extensions offer a convenient
                   way to incrementally modify existing classes when
                   subclassing is inappropriate. Unfortunately existing
                   approaches suffer from various limitations. Either
                   class extensions have a global impact, with possibly
                   negative effects for unexpected clients, or they have a
                   purely local impact, with negative results for
                   collaborating clients. Furthermore, conflicting class
                   extensions are either disallowed, or resolved by
                   linearization, with subsequent negative effects. To
                   solve these problems we present classboxes, a module
                   system for object-oriented languages that provides for
                   behavior refinement (i.e. method addition and
                   replacement). Moreover, the changes made by a classbox
                   are only visible to that classbox (or classboxes that
                   import it), a feature we call local rebinding. We
                   present an experimental validation in which we apply
                   the classbox model to both dynamically and statically
                   typed programming languages. We used classboxes to
                   refactor part of the {Java} Swing library, and we show
                   two extensions built on top of classboxes which are (i)
                   runtime adaptation with dynamically classboxes and (ii)
                   expressing crosscutting changes.},

                   like Simula, Beta, Eiffel, are desirable because of the

                   Dynamically-typed, interpreted languages, like
                   Smalltalk, are useful as they provide the possibility
                   of dynamically extending a program. In this paper, we
                   reconcile the safety and efficiency goals of compiled
                   languages with the benefits of interpreted languages by
                   presenting an embeddable interpreter for a compiled
                   language, namely Beta. The interpreter is designed to
                   be embedded into any compiled Beta application, thus
                   enabling it to accept dynamic extensions. This paper
                   examines the Application Programmer's Interface to the

                   maintenance is to detect and recognize recurring
                   collaborations among software artifacts that are
                   implicit in the code. These collaboration patterns are
                   typically signs of applied idioms, conventions and
                   design patterns during the development of the system,
                   and may entail implicit contracts that should be
                   respected during maintenance, but are not documented
                   explicitly. In this paper we apply Formal Concept
                   Analysis to detect implicit collaboration patterns. Our
                   approach generalizes Antoniol and Tonella one for
                   detecting classical design patterns. We introduce a
                   variation to their algorithm to reduce the computation
                   time of the concepts, a language-independent approach
                   for object-oriented languages, and a post-processing
                   phase in which pattern candidates are filtered out. We
                   identify collaboration patterns in the analyzed
                   applications, match them against libraries of known
                   design patterns, and establish relationships between
                   detected patterns and their nearest neighbours. },

                   spawns lots of specialised tools to edit code, employ
                   UML schemes, integrate documentation, and so on. The
                   problem is that the tool builders themselves are
                   responsible for making their tools interoperable with
                   other tools or development environments. Because they
                   cannot anticipate all other tools they can integrate
                   with, a lot of tools cannot co-operate. This paper
                   introduces the classication model, a lightweight
                   integration medium that enables unrelated tools that
                   were not meant to be integrated to cooperate easily.
                   Moreover, the tool integration is done by a tool
                   integrator, and not by the tool builder. To validate
                   this claim, we show how to integrate several
                   third-party tools using the classication model, and how
                   it forms the foundation for the StarBrowser, a
                   Smalltalk browser integrating different tools.},

  abstract       = {Darwin is a programming system for the development of
                   distributed and parallel programs. Darwin programs
                   consist of three parts. Firstly, there is a
                   configuration part which provides a hierarchical
                   structure of components with dynamic binding. Secondly,
                   there is the actual communication part which provides
                   the interaction and synchronisation required by the
                   system. Finally, there is the computation part
                   providing the component programs written in C++. The
                   subdivision of concurrent programs into the three
                   separate parts of organisation, communication and
                   computation leads to programs that are easy to specify,
                   compile and execute. In order to specify precisely the
                   behaviour of Darwin programs, we translate the
                   organisation and communication into the Pi-calculus, a
                   formalism for modelling concurrent processes. The
                   Pi-calculus semantics enables us to deduce behavioural
                   properties of Darwin programs.},

                   components and connectors at the design stage has been
                   promoted as a way to describe and reason about complex
                   software architectures. There is, however, surprisingly
                   little language support for this decomposition at
                   implementation level. Interaction relationships which
                   are identified at design time are lost as they get
                   spread out into the participating entities at
                   implementation. In this paper, we propose first-class
                   connectors in an object-oriented language as a first
                   step towards making software architecture more explicit
                   at implementation level. Our connectors are run-time
                   entities which control the interaction of components
                   and can express a rich repertoire of interaction
                   relationships. We show how connectors can be reused and
                   how they enhance the reuse of components.},

                   platforms such as the World Wide Web, parts of
                   applications are increasingly packaged as components.
                   Encapsulating the coordination of these multiple
                   subsystems as generic components has proven difficult,
                   because typically coordination affects multiple

                   requirements, such as interoperability and security,
                   must also be dealt with. We have investigated
                   coordination as a variability aspect of open

                   design and the design rationale from a functioning
                   software system. Reverse engineering is an integral
                   part of any successful software system, because
                   changing requirements lead to implementations that
                   drift from their original design. In contrast to
                   traditional reverse engineering techniques -which
                   analyse a single snapshot of a system- we focus the
                   reverse engineering effort by determining where the
                   implementation has changed. Since changes of
                   object-oriented software are often phrased in terms of
                   refactorings, we propose a set of heuristics for
                   detecting refactorings by applying lightweight,
                   object-oriented metrics to successive versions of a
                   software system. We validate our approach with three
                   separate case studies of mature object-oriented
                   software systems for which multiple versions are
                   available. The case studies suggest that the heuristics
                   support the reverse engineering process by focusing
                   attention on the relevant parts of a software system.},

                   The specification describes the system as a society of
                   `agents', each of them being characterised (i) by its
                   responsibility with respect to actions happening in the

                   Unfortunately, most software development environments
                   do not adequately supp ort the declaration and use of
                   such patterns. To explicitly codify these patterns, we
                   adopt a declarative meta programming approach. In this
                   approach, we reify the structure of an
                   (object-oriented) program in terms of logic clauses. We
                   declare programmi ng patterns as logic rules on top of
                   these clauses. By querying the logic system, these
                   rules allow us to check, enforce and search for
                   occurrences of certain patterns in the software. As
                   such, the programming patterns become an active part of

                   Distributed Memory Parallel Computers (DMPCs) mainly
                   consist of libraries of routines to handle
                   communications between processes written in sequential
                   languages such as C or Fortran. This approach makes it
                   difficult to program massively parallel systems in both
                   an easy and efficient way. Another approach relies on
                   (semi-)automatic parallelizing compilers but it has its
                   own drawbacks. We propose to tackle this problem at an
                   intermediate level (i.e. between high level
                   parallelizing compilers and raw libraries), using
                   Object Oriented (OO) technologies. We show that
                   existing OO techniques based on the reuse of carefully
                   designed software components can be applied with
                   satisfactory results to the large scale scientific
                   computation field. We propose to use a form of
                   parallelism, known as data parallelism, and to embed it
                   in a pure sequential OOL (Eiffel). We illustrate on
                   several examples how sequential components and
                   frameworks can be modified for parallel execution on
                   DM- PCs to allow for transparent parallelisation of
                   classes using these components and frameworks.},

                   no one single approach will be the best for all
                   coordination problems. Different coordination styles
                   exhibiting different properties may be more suitable
                   for some problems than others. Like other architectural
                   styles, coordination styles can be expressed in terms
                   of components, connectors and composition rules. We
                   propose an approach in which coordination styles are
                   expressed as component algebras: components of various
                   sorts can be combined using operators that realize
                   their coordination, yielding other sorts of components.
                   We show how several coordination styles can be defined
                   and applied using Piccola, a small language for
                   composing software components. We furthermore show how
                   glue abstractions can be used to bridge coordination
                   styles when more than one style is needed for a single
                   application.},

                   very suitable for building distributed system
                   architectures since object interactions follow the
                   client-server model. To cope with the complexity of
                   today's distributed systems, however, we think that
                   high-level linguistic mechanisms are needed to
                   effectively structure, abstract and reuse object
                   interactions. For example, the conventional
                   object-oriented model does not provide high-level
                   language mechanisms to model layered system
                   architectures. Moreover, we consider the message
                   passing model of the conventional object-oriented model
                   as being too low-level because it can only specify
                   object interactions that involve two partner objects at
                   a time and its semantics cannot be extended easily.
                   This paper introduces Abstract Communication Types
                   (ACTs), which are objects that abstract interactions
                   among objects. ACT s make it easier to model layered
                   communication architectures, to enforce the invariant
                   behavior among objects, to reduce the complexity of
                   programs by hiding the interaction details in separate
                   modules and to improve reusability through the
                   application of object-oriented principles to ACT
                   classes. We illustrate the concept of ACT s using the
                   composition filters model.},

                   for improving object-oriented software systems.
                   Unfortunately, all of the current refactoring tools
                   depend on language-dependent refactoring engines, which
                   prevents a smooth integration with mainstream

                   the similarities between refactorings for Smalltalk and
                   {Java}, derive a language-independent meta-model and
                   show that it is feasible to build a

                   meta-model. Our feasibility study is validated by means
                   of a tool prototype which uses the same engine to
                   refactor both Smalltalk and {Java} code. Using our
                   approach we minimize the language-dependent part of
                   refactoring tools, providing a standard way for
                   programmers and tools to perform refactorings no matter
                   what language they work in.},

                   even more difficult to maintain in the face of changing
                   requirements. The complexity of software evolution can,
                   however, be significantly reduced if we manage to
                   separate the stable artifacts (the components) from
                   their configuration (the scripts). We have proposed a
                   simple, unifying framework of forms, agents, and
                   channels for modelling components and scripts, and we
                   have developed an experimental composition language,
                   called Piccola, based on this framework, that supports
                   the specification of applications as flexible
                   compositions of stable components. In this paper we
                   show how Piccola can be used to reduce the complexity
                   of software evolution through the specification and use
                   of an appropriate compositional style, and we
                   illustrate the approach through a non-trivial example
                   of mixin layer composition. },

  Type           = {Master's thesis},
  abstract       = {Many approaches have been developed to comprehend
                   software source code, most of them focusing on program
                   structural information. However, in doing so we are
                   missing a crucial information, namely, the domain
                   semantics information contained in the text or symbols
                   of the source code. When we are to understand software
                   as a whole, we need to enrich these approaches with
                   conceptual insights gained from the domain semantics.
                   This paper proposes the use of information retrieval
                   techniques to exploit linguistic information, such as
                   identifier names and comments in source code, to gain
                   insights into how the domain is mapped to the code. We
                   introduce Semantic Clustering, an algorithm to group
                   source artifacts based on how they use similar terms.
                   The algorithm uses Latent Semantic Indexing. After
                   detecting the clusters, we provide an automatic
                   labeling and then we visually explore how the clusters
                   are spread over the system. Our approach works at the
                   source code textual level which makes it language
                   independent. Nevertheless, we correlate the semantics
                   with structural information and we apply it at
                   different levels of abstraction (for example packages,
                   classes, methods). To validate our approach we applied
                   it on several case studies.},

                   Patterns addresses the problem of understanding and

                   described in this book have been observed and validated

                   with first-class types. FACE can be used to model
                   software, e.g. object oriented frameworks. We explore
                   techniques and mechanisms to implement the reflective
                   FACE data model in the statically typed, object
                   oriented language C++. Some comparison of FACE with
                   other meta level approaches like MetaObject Protocols
                   or Open Implementations is done, and a short example
                   modeling software is described.},

                   as private, protected, or public to control who can see
                   what. However, these visibility mechanisms are fixed
                   once for all. Moreover, they do not solve all problems
                   related to the visibility, and are typically of a
                   static nature. In this position paper we present an
                   open and uniform way of dealing with visibility and
                   introduce surfaces: i.e., list of methods that control
                   the way the behavior of an ob ject is accessible. We
                   introduce two problems that other visibility mechanisms
                   cannot solve, and show how surfaces can.},

                   systems. The problem with traditional approaches to
                   software engineering is well in evidence in the field
                   of office information systems: it is costly and
                   difficult to extend existing applications, and to get
                   unrelated applications to ``talk'' to each other. The
                   object-oriented approach is already being tentatively
                   applied in the modeling of ``office objects'' and in
                   the presentation of these entities to users as such in
                   ``desktop'' interfaces to office software. In order to
                   fully exploit the approach to achieve integrated office
                   systems, we need to use object-oriented programming
                   languages, object-oriented run-time support, and
                   object-oriented software engineering environments.},

                   computer animation. Since the pieces of an animation
                   can come from various media such as computer-generated
                   imagery, video, and sound, the case for object
                   orientation is all the stronger. However, languages for
                   expressing the temporal co-ordination of animated
                   objects have been slow in coming. We present such a
                   language in this paper. Since the movements that an
                   animated object can perform are also encapsulated as
                   objects in our system, the scripting language can also
                   be used to specify motion co-ordination. Such "motion
                   objects" can be applied to any animated object. The
                   syntax, semantics, and implementation of this language
                   will be described, and we shall show how to specify
                   device-independent computer animation.},

  abstract       = {Software visualization tools face many challenges in
                   terms of their implementation, including scalability,
                   usability, adaptability, and durability. Such tools,
                   like many other research tools, tend to have a short
                   life cycle and are vulnerble to software evolution
                   processes because of the complex problem domain and the
                   constantly changing requirements which are dictated by
                   research goals. In this paper we discuss the
                   implementation of the software visualization tool
                   CodeCrawler according to five criteria, namely the
                   overall architecture, the internal architecture, the
                   visualization engine, the metamodel and the interactive
                   facilities. This discussion generates implementation
                   recommendations and design guidelines that hold for our
                   tool and the class of tools its stands for. We then
                   also extract common design guidelines and
                   recommendations that apply for other software
                   visualization and general reverse engineering tools as
                   well, and hope that these insights can be used
                   fruitfully by other researchers in this field.},

  abstract       = {We live in a world where we are surrounded with
                   information technology. The software systems around us
                   are countless. All of those systems have been written
                   once and must be maintained today. While a system
                   evolves it becomes difficult to maintain. We use
                   reengineering tools today to simplify maintenance
                   tasks. With the support of such tools we can change the
                   form of software systems in a way that makes them
                   easier to analyze. Before we can use any reengineering
                   tool with a software system we must reverse engineer
                   that system. To reverse engineer a software system
                   means that we need to build a model from the system.
                   This model represents our system in a more abstract way
                   than the source code itself does. The way from the
                   source code to the model is often a problem. If a
                   reengineering tool supports a specific model the
                   maintainers of that tool must provide a parser for
                   every programming language they want to support. Such
                   parsers translate source code written in a particular
                   language into a model. There are so many languages used
                   in systems today that it is not possible to support all
                   of them. Additionally, the languages themselves evolve
                   and so we need parsers for every version and every
                   dialect of a programming language. There are a number
                   of approaches to solve that problem (for example fuzzy
                   parsing). Most of these approaches are not flexible
                   enough for today's needs: We cannot adapt them to
                   another programming language or if we can we need a lot
                   of knowledge about the language and about the whole
                   parsing technique. Depending on the technique that we
                   use we must write a parser or at least a grammar as a
                   basis for a parser generator. In most of the cases this
                   is a difficult and time-consuming task. Our idea is to
                   build an application that generates parsers based on
                   mapping examples. A mapping example is a section in the
                   source code to which we assign an element in our target
                   model. Based on these examples, our application builds
                   grammars and generates a parser. If the parser fails to
                   parse some code our application asks the user to
                   provide more examples. This approach is flexible enough
                   to work with a software system written in an arbitrary
                   programming language. The user does not need to have
                   knowledge about parsing. However, he should be able to
                   recognize the elements in the source code that he wants
                   to map on the elements in the target model. We prove
                   the flexibility of that approach with our reference
                   implementation called CodeSnooper. This application
                   works with any input. As target model we take the FAMIX
                   model that is used by the MOOSE reengineering
                   environment. },

                   promote the reuse of methods between unrelated classes.
                   This paper reports on a refactoring of the Smalltalk
                   collections classes using traits. The original
                   collection classes contained much duplication of code;
                   traits let us remove all of it. We also found places
                   where the protocols of the collections lacked
                   uniformity; traits allowed us to correct these
                   non-uniformities without code duplication. Traits also
                   make it possible to reuse fragments of collection code
                   outside of the existing hierarchy; for example, they
                   make it easy to convert other collection-like things
                   into true collections. Our refactoring reduced the
                   number of methods in the collection classes by
                   approximately 10 per cent. More importantly,
                   understandability maintainability and reusability of
                   the code were significantly improved.},

  abstract       = {Many of the shortcomings of present-day
                   object-oriented programming languages can be traced to
                   two phenomena: (i) the lack of general support for
                   software composition, and (ii) the semantic
                   interference between language features addressing
                   operational and compositional aspects of
                   object-oriented programming. To remedy this situation,
                   we propose the development of a "pattern language" for
                   active objects in which objects and, more generally,
                   applications, are constructed by composing software
                   patterns. A "pattern" can be any reusable software
                   abstraction, including functions, objects, classes and
                   generics. In this paper we seek to establish both
                   informal requirements for a pattern language and a
                   formal basis for defining the semantics of patterns.
                   First, we identify some basic requirements for
                   supporting object composition and we review the
                   principal language design choices with respect to these
                   requirements. We then survey the various problems of
                   semantic interference in existing languages. Next, we
                   present a formal "object calculus" and show how it can
                   be used to define the semantics of patterns in much the
                   same way that the lambda calculus can be used to give
                   meaning to constructs of functional programming
                   languages. We conclude by summarizing the principle
                   open problems that remain to define a practical pattern
                   language for active objects.},

                   are those based on inheritance, on reorganizing a class

                   between classes that is just as important as
                   inheritance, and many changes to an object-oriented
                   design involve the aggregate/component relationship.
                   This paper describes some common refactorings based on
                   aggregation, including how to convert from inheritance
                   to an aggregation, and how to reorganize an

                   focused on the development of special coordination
                   languages and environments that provide the basic
                   mechanisms for realizing the coordination layer of an
                   open system. It is clear that the idea of managing
                   separately the coordination aspect from the computation
                   in a language has a lot of advantages in the
                   development of those systems. Nevertheless, most of the
                   coordination languages do not take care that
                   additionally to managing coordination requirements,
                   they must manage other kinds of "openness" related
                   requirements in Open Systems. The most important
                   requirement being to support the evolution of the
                   coordination requirements themselves. This problem
                   manifests during the software development process by
                   the development over and over again of solutions to
                   similar coordination problems. To tackle this problem,
                   and instead of proposing a new language, we are
                   attempting to develop an open set of adaptable and
                   reusable software components that realize various
                   useful coordination abstractions. With these components
                   we provide explicit separation of coordination from

                   in an arbitrary order, but developers want to focus on
                   the most specific ones first. We therefore inferred a
                   partial order of unit tests corresponding to a coverage
                   hierarchy of their sets of covered method signatures:
                   When several unit tests in this coverage hierarchy
                   break, we can guide the developer to the test calling
                   the smallest number of methods. Our experiments with
                   four case studies indicate that this partial order is
                   semantically meaningful, since faults that cause a unit
                   test to break generally cause less specific unit tests
                   to break as well.},

                   location independent object invocation but also has to
                   cope with various object management operations. These
                   meta-operations include object migration, object
                   replication and granularity control. Additionally, in a

                   specifications defined on an object by the application

                   transparently. This scheme {based on reference objects}
                   is generic in the sense that it can be extented to

                   between scripting models, defining the allowed
                   components and kinds of connections between them, and
                   scripting tools, helping to build scripts in accordance
                   to the underlying model. We describe the implementation
                   of the Visual Scripting Tool VST which supports the
                   construction of scripts through the interactive editing
                   of scripts' visual counterparts. The current version of
                   the VST supports the UNIX shell scripting model.
                   Extensions to VST supporting different scripting models
                   are discussed.},

  abstract       = {A class extension is a method that is defined in a
                   module, but whose class is defined elsewhere. Class
                   extensions offer a convenient way to incrementally
                   modify existing classes when subclassing is
                   inappropriate. Unfortunately existing approaches suffer
                   from various limitations. Either class extensions have
                   a global impact, with possibly negative effects for
                   unexpected clients, or they have a purely local impact,
                   with negative results for collaborating clients.
                   Furthermore, conflicting class extensions are either
                   disallowed, or resolved by linearization, with
                   consequent negative effects. To solve these problems we
                   present classboxes, a module system for object-oriented
                   languages that provides for method addition and
                   replacement. Moreover, the changes made by a classbox
                   are only visible to that classbox (or classboxes that
                   import it), a feature we call local rebinding. To
                   validate the model we have implemented it in the Squeak
                   Smalltalk environment, and performed benchmarks.},

                   information when reasoning about the systems at hand or
                   when reasoning about general laws of software
                   evolution. Over the past 30 years more and more
                   research has been spent on understanding software
                   evolution. However, the approaches developed so far do
                   not rely on an explicit meta-model, and thus, they make
                   it difficult to reuse or compare their results. We
                   argue that there is a need for an explicit meta-model
                   for software evolution analysis. We present a survey of
                   the evolution analyses and deduce a set of requirements
                   that an evolution meta-model should have. We define,
                   Hismo, a meta-model in which history is modeled as an
                   explicit entity. Hismo adds a time layer on top of
                   structural information, and provides a common
                   infrastructure for expressing and combining evolution
                   analyses and structural analyses. We validate the
                   usefulness of our a meta-model by presenting how
                   different analyses are expressed on it.},

                   finding and fixing bugs take a huge percentage of the
                   overall time and resources. Traditional debugging and
                   stepping execution trace are well-accepted techniques
                   to understand deep internals about a program. However
                   in many cases navigating the stack trace is not enough
                   to find bugs, since the cause of a bug is often not in
                   the stack trace anymore and old state is lost, so out
                   of reach from the debugger. Therefore there is a
                   challenge in providing new ways of debugging. In this
                   work, we present the design and implementation of a
                   backward-in-time debugger for a dynamic language, i.e.,
                   a debugger that allows one to navigate back the history
                   of the application. We present the design and
                   implementation of a backward-in-time debugger called
                   Unstuck and show our solution to key implementation

                   and adapt features of an application in response to
                   changing requirements. The problem is that just by
                   reading the source code, it is difficult to determine
                   how classes and methods contribute to the runtime
                   behavior of features. Moreover, dependencies between
                   system features are not obvious, consequently software
                   maintenance operations often result in unintended side
                   effects. To tackle these problems, we propose a compact
                   feature-driven approach (i.e, summarized trace
                   information) based on dynamic analysis to characterize
                   features and computational units of an application. We
                   extract execution traces to achieve an explicit mapping
                   between features and classes using two complementary
                   perspectives. We apply our approach to two case studies
                   and we report our findings.},

                   development environment is an appropriate software
                   repository. We present a repository system which
                   supports the entire software development lifecycle,
                   providing for the integrated and consistent
                   representation, organization, storage, and management
                   of reusable artefacts. The system can support multiple
                   development and representation models and is
                   dynamically adaptable to new ones. The chapter focuses
                   on the facilities offered by the system for component
                   classification, an important technique for retrieving
                   reusable software. It is demonstrated that the
                   inherently delicate and complex process of
                   classification is streamlined and considerably
                   facilitated by integrating it into a wider
                   documentation environment and, especially, by
                   connecting it with software static analysis. The
                   benefits in terms of precision, consistency and ease of
                   use can be significant for large scale applications.},

                   object oriented database systems. The framework
                   contains two parts. The first is a structural object
                   model, including concepts such as structured objects,
                   identity, and some form of inheritance. For this model,
                   the paper explains the distinction between values and
                   abstract objects, describes a system as a directed
                   graph, and discusses declarative languages. The second
                   part deals with higher-order concepts, such as classes
                   and functions as data, methods, and inheritance. This
                   part is a sketch, and leaves many issues unresolved.
                   Throughout the paper, the emphasis is on logic-oriented

                   development tools and environments, in order to take
                   architectural descriptions into account, is a topical
                   issue. Nowadays, the existing formalisms to represent
                   software architecture fail in providing a clear
                   semantics and only give an intuitive graphical
                   representation of the system as a whole. More
                   specifically, the framework architectures should show
                   the overall design and the specification of the points
                   of the variability of the framework, making easier the
                   reuse of the architectures, integration with others
                   frameworks and a reference to measure the changes in
                   subsequent versions of the frameworks. In this paper we
                   propose an approach to describe the architecture of
                   frameworks, combining formal and non-formal formalisms:
                   Wright, an architectural description language developed
                   at Carnegie Mellon University, and architectural
                   patterns. Based on the study of several frameworks, our
                   objective was to produce a complete description of a
                   framework, to show the expressive power of both
                   approaches and to consider complementarity and
                   flexibility regarding to other approaches.},

                   computing that it is frequently overlooked or taken for
                   granted. Our research is aimed at developing both
                   \fImodels\fR to improve understanding and
                   \fImechanisms\fR to improve practical application of
                   name management approaches in various computing
                   domains. one domain that seems to have particularly
                   strong connections to name management is object
                   technology for advanced software. Object technology has
                   already proven very useful in our investigation of name
                   management models and mechanisms. We also see great
                   potential for beneficial application of improved name
                   management mechanisms to object technology for advanced
                   software. In this paper, we first outline our overall
                   approach to research on name management and discuss
                   some specific name management concerns arising in
                   object technology for advanced software. We then
                   illustrate the application of object technology in our
                   efforts to construct name management models and
                   mechanisms. Finally we give an example of how enhanced
                   name management mechanisms might be incorporated into a
                   representative instance of object technology for
                   advanced software.},

  abstract       = {The increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern
                   networks has pushed industry and research towards a
                   single and consistent way of managing networks. The
                   effort to define a single industry-standard API for
                   network management basically failed because it did not
                   address aspects like complexity and ease of
                   programming. Recently, a common approach is to map
                   established network management standards into another
                   object model, often based on the emerging Corba
                   standard. Unfortunately even this approach has shown
                   many drawbacks related primarily to the significant
                   amount of code that has to be linked with the final
                   application and to the many limitations and
                   imperfections of the mapping itself. This paper
                   describes a new approach to inter-domain management
                   that attempts to overcome the limitations of current
                   solutions. The goal is to allow people to write hybrid
                   CMIP and SNMP-based network management applications
                   using a single and simple object model. Relevant
                   characteristics of this approach are that it is light,
                   extensible, object-oriented, language-neutral, built
                   upon software-components, string-syntax based and
                   Internet-ready. This demonstrates that it is feasible
                   to implement simple and light applications for
                   inter-domain management without the need for expensive
                   or complex technologies.},

                   development methodologies, recent years have seen the
                   introduction of more light-weight or "agile"
                   development processes. These processes are intended to
                   support early and quick production of working code by
                   structuring the development into small release cycles
                   and focus on continual interaction between developers
                   and customers. As these kinds of software development
                   processes are becoming more and more popular in
                   industry, there is a growing demand to expose Software
                   Engineering students to agile development practices.
                   This, however, is not a straightforward task as the
                   corresponding practices cannot be adjusted easily to a
                   learning environment or may even run counter to
                   educational goals. In this paper, we discuss our
                   experiences in introducing agile practices in student
                   software development projects and reflect on both the

  abstract       = {A software system may become very large during its
                   evolution, getting less maintain-able while its
                   complexity rises. Since replacing the system with a new
                   one is often out of question because of economic
                   considerations, reengineering techniques are being
                   developed to change the system into a form which makes
                   it easier to maintain and to further develop. However,
                   before a system can be reengineered, it has to be
                   reverse engineered in order to understand its nature
                   and inner logic. This work deals with a lightweight
                   approach to software reverse engineering com-bining
                   simple graphs with simple object oriented metrics. Our
                   goal is to obtain a simple and scalable graphical
                   display of a system and its parts through which we
                   succeed to visually extract information, which is
                   useful to the understanding of the system and the
                   detection of its design problems. The primary goal of
                   this work is to put up a repository of combinations of
                   graphs and metrics which are useful to reverse engineer
                   an object oriented system. To validate our approach we
                   implemented a tool called CodeCrawler, which can
                   graphically dis-play source code while providing a
                   layer of interactivity to the user: we use the term
                   navigating the code. We ran CodeCrawler on two
                   Smalltalk case studies and one large industrial case
                   study written in C++. The positive experiences and
                   reactions which we obtained are a proof of the
                   usefulness of our idea.},

                   context of software communities --- groups of designers
                   and developers sharing knowledge and experience. One
                   way of fostering reuse of this experience is by
                   establishing large collections of reusable object
                   classes. Resulting problems include: Class packaging
                   and class organization --- how can classes and their
                   methods be represented to simplify reuse. Class
                   selection and exploration --- what query and browsing
                   facilities are needed by developers in order to
                   facilitate software reuse. Class evolution --- how may
                   the class hierarchy be reorganized as a result of
                   changes introduced by developers. These issues are
                   illustrated by examining prototype tools and systems

                   dynamically without shutting down and restarting the
                   application. In this paper we present an extension of
                   classboxes to make them dynamic. A classbox is a kind
                   of module that supports class extension and instance
                   variable addition. Class extensions and definitions
                   defined in a classbox represent an aspect. In addition,
                   with classboxes, aspects are dynamically applied to,
                   removed from hot- in a system. Such aspects may
                   crosscut a large number of classes which are extended
                   by adding or redefining existing methods and adding new
                   instance variables. Finally the aspects are scoped

                   construction that relies on the connection of reusable
                   components. The approach is derived from the
                   observation that a design framework plays a central
                   role in the reuse process in the sense that both the
                   design of applications and the design of reusable
                   components must follow the same design discipline. The
                   interaction between components is mediated by an
                   object: the gluon. Gluons are attached to reusable
                   components and they represent the rights to a service
                   provided by the component. Gluons can be seen as
                   coupons: once detached they grant a service that can be
                   exchanged among objects. Gluons can also encapsulate an
                   activity performed by a set of cooperating components.
                   With this approach, the construction of applications
                   can be seen as a market where components that ask for
                   services can purchase rights from other components that
                   offer them.},

  abstract       = {There is considerable interest in programs that can
                   migrate from one host to another and execute. Mobile
                   programs are appealing because they support efficient
                   utilization of network resources and extensibility of
                   information servers. However, since they cross
                   administrative domains, they have the ability to access
                   and possibly misuse a host's protected resources. In
                   this paper, we present a novel approach for controlling
                   and protecting a site's resources. In this approach, a
                   site uses a declarative policy language to specify a
                   set of constraints on accesses to resources. A set of
                   code transformation tools enforces these constraints on
                   mobile programs by integrating the access constraint
                   checking code directly into the mobile program and
                   resource definitions. Because our approach does not
                   require resources to make explicit calls to a reference
                   monitor, it does not depend upon a specific runtime
                   system implementation.},

                   benefit from the expertise developed in earlier
                   efforts. It is therefore essential to have a way to
                   communicate expertise at different levels: from
                   knowledge about how to approach a system to be
                   reengineered, to knowledge about improving code by
                   eliminating 'bad' style. In this paper we propose to
                   use a pattern form to communicate knowledge about
                   reengineering. A reengineering pattern connects an
                   observable problem in the code to a reengineering goal:
                   it describes the process of going from the existing
                   legacy solution causing or aggravating the problem to a
                   new refactored solution which meets the reengineering
                   goal. It thus gives a method appropriate for a specific
                   problem, rather than proposing a general methodology,
                   and makes reference to the appropriate tools or
                   techniques for obtaining the refactored solution. In
                   this paper we discuss the role of reengineering
                   patterns and contrast them with related kinds of
                   patterns. We then highlight the form of reengineering
                   patterns and present two simple patterns for type-check
                   elimination.},

                   complicates the maintenance and evolution of large
                   software systems. Good tools for detecting duplicated
                   code are scarce because of the large amount of data to
                   be checked, because duplicated code is not known a
                   priori and because especially it requires parsing
                   technology. In this paper we show that is possible to
                   circumvent these complicating factors by applying a
                   language independent and lightweigth approach, i.e. a
                   tool that requires no parsing and a little learning and
                   configuration time, yet is able to detect a significant
                   amount of code duplication. We validate our approach on
                   a number of case studies, involving five different
                   implementation languages and ranging from 256 K up

                   problems for software maintenance, it is difficult to
                   identify in large systems. Many different techniques
                   have been developed to detect software clones, some of
                   which are very sophisticated, but are also expensive to
                   implement and adapt. Lightweight techniques based on
                   simple string matching are easy to implement, but how
                   effective are they? We present a simple stringbased
                   approach which we have successfully applied to a number
                   of different languages such COBOL, {Java}, C++, Pascal,
                   Python, Smalltalk, C and PDP-11 assembler. In each case
                   the maximum time to adapt the approach to a new
                   language was less than 45 minutes. In this article we
                   investigate a number of simple variants of string-based
                   clone detection that abstract away from common editing
                   operations, and assess the quality of clone detection
                   for very different case studies. Our results confirm
                   that this inexpensive clone detection technique
                   generally achieves high recall and acceptable
                   precision. Over-zealous normalization of the code
                   before comparison, however, can result in unacceptable
                   numbers of false positives. },

                   extensibility, and we are developing tools and

                   systems. In this talk we review problems and
                   limitations with object-oriented and component-based

                   choosing as a host platform a language having advanced

                   implementation provides very expressive reflective

                   plain standard objects and reification of method

                   unfoldings in which an agent, or a system of concurrent
                   agents, may participate. Furthermore, we introduce a

                   components can be difficult to deploy in embedded
                   systems because of non-functional requirements. Pecos
                   is a collaborative project between industrial and
                   research partners that seeks to enable component-based
                   technology for a class of embedded systems known as
                   field devices. In this paper we introduce a component
                   model for field devices that captures a range of
                   non-functional properties and constraints. We report on
                   the current status of Pecos, including the Pecos
                   composition language, language mappings to {Java} and

  Institution    = {University of Manchester},
  Type           = {UMCS-92-12-1},
  abstract       = {The property of a (formal) development method which
                   gives the development process the potential for
                   productivity is compositionality. Interference is what
                   makes it difficult to find compositional development
                   methods for concurrent systems. This paper is intended
                   to contribute to tractable development methods for
                   concurrent programs. In particular it explores ways in
                   which object-based language concepts can be used to
                   provide a compositional development method for
                   concurrent programs. This text summarizes results from
                   three draft papers. It firstly shows how object-based
                   concepts can be used to provide a designer with control
                   over interference and proposes a transformational style
                   of development (for systems with limited interference)
                   in which concurrency is introduced only in the final
                   stages of design. The essential idea here is to show
                   that certain object graphs limit interference.
                   Secondly, the paper shows how a suitable logic can be
                   used to reason about those systems where interference
                   plays an essential role. Here again, concepts are used
                   in the design notation which are taken from
                   object-oriented languages since they offer control of
                   granularity and way of pinpointing interference.
                   Thirdly, the paper outlines the semantics of the design
                   notation mapping its constructs to Milner's $pi$c.},

                   common tasks. Cooperative Object Information Systems
                   are systems constrained to continuously adapt to new
                   requirements: new objects are introduced into the
                   systems, cooperation protocols change, etc. Building
                   Cooperative Object Information Systems is difficult
                   because most of the concurrent and distributed object
                   oriented programming languages and frameworks used to
                   build them, provide only limited support for their
                   specification and abstraction, making them difficult to
                   understand, modify and customize. We show in this paper

                   oriented coordination models and languages,

                   depending on the context in which they are running.
                   Since context-specific behavior tends to crosscut base
                   programs, it can advantageously be implemented as
                   aspects. This leads to the notion of context-aware
                   aspects, e.g., aspects whose behavior depends on
                   context. This paper analyzes the issue of appropriate
                   support from the aspect language to both restrict the
                   scope of aspects according to the context and allow
                   aspect definitions to access information associated to
                   the context. We propose an open framework for
                   context-aware aspects that allows for the definition of
                   first-class contexts and supports the definition of
                   context awareness constructs for aspects, including the
                   ability to refer to past contexts, and to provide
                   domain- and application-specific constructs.},

  abstract       = {Software components developed with an object-oriented
                   language undergo considerable reprogramming before they
                   become reusable in a wide range of applications or
                   domains. Tools and methodologies are therefore needed
                   to cope with the complexity of designing, updating and
                   reorganizing vast collections of classes. This paper
                   describes several techniques for controlling change in
                   object-oriented systems, illustrates their
                   functionality with selected examples and discusses
                   their advantages and their limitations. As a complement
                   to traditional approaches like version management, we
                   propose new algorithms for automatically restructuring
                   a hierarchy when classes are added to it. These
                   algorithms not only help in handling modifications to
                   libraries of software components, but they also provide
                   useful guidance for detecting and correcting improper

                   immutable records. Forms and agents allow us to unify
                   components, static and dynamic contexts and arguments
                   for invoking services. Through a series of examples, we
                   present a tour of Piccola, illustrating how forms and
                   agents suffice to express a variety of compositional
                   abstractions and styles.},

                   functionality of database systems to manage their
                   objects. Persistence, object identity, storage
                   management, distribution and obc control are some of
                   the things that database systems traditionally handle
                   well. Unfortunately there is a fundamental difference
                   in philosophy between the object-oriented and database
                   approaches, namely that of object independence versus
                   data independence. We discuss the ways in which this
                   difference in outlook manifests itself, and we consider
                   the possibilities for resolving the two views,
                   including the current work on object-oriented
                   databases. We conclude by proposing an approach to
                   co-existence that blurs the boundary between the
                   object-oriented execution environment and the database.},

                   of (4) Type disciplines and object classes are a great
                   help in avoiding these errors. Stronger protection may
                   be obtainable with the help of assertions, particularly
                   invariants, which are intended to be true before and
                   after each call of a method that updates the structure
                   of the heap. This note introduces a mathematical model
                   and language for the formulation of assertions about
                   objects and pointers, and sug- gests that a graphical
                   calculus [Curtis, Lowe] may help in reasoning about
                   program correctness. It deals with both
                   garbage-collected heaps and the other kind. The theory
                   is based on a trace model of graphs, using ideas from
                   process algebra; and our development seeks to exploit
                   this analogy as a unifying principle.},

  abstract       = {The key requirement for open systems is that they be
                   flexible, or recomposable. This suggests that they must
                   first of all be composable. Object-oriented techniques
                   help by allowing applications to be viewed as
                   compositions of collaborating objects, but are limited
                   in supporting other kinds of abstractions that may have
                   finer or coarser granularity than objects. A
                   composition language supports the technical
                   requirements of a component-oriented development
                   approach by shifting emphasis from programming and
                   inheritance of classes to specification and composition
                   of components. Objects are viewed as processes, and
                   components are abstractions over the object space. An
                   application is viewed as an explicit composition of
                   software components. By making software architectures
                   explicit and manipulable, we expect to better support
                   application evolution and flexibility. In this position
                   paper we will elaborate our requirements and outline a
                   strategy for the design and implementation of a
                   composition language for the development of open

                   the maintainability of large software systems.
                   Techniques for detecting duplicated code exist but they
                   rely mostly on parsers, technology that is often
                   fragile in the face of different languages and
                   dialects. In this paper we show that a lightweight
                   approach based on simple string-matching can be
                   effectively used to detect a significant amount of code
                   duplication. The approach scales well, and can be
                   easily adapted to different languages and contexts. We
                   validate our approach by applying it to a number of
                   industrial and open source case studies, involving five
                   different implementation languages and ranging from
                   256KB to 13MB of source code. Finally, we compare our
                   approach to a more sophisticated one employing
                   parameterized matching, and demonstrate that little if
                   anything is gained by adopting a more heavyweight
                   approach.},

                   for reuse in ob ject-oriented languages. Unfortunately,
                   due to the coarse granularity of inheritance, it may be
                   difficult to decompose an application into an optimal
                   class hierarchy that maximizes software reuse. Existing
                   schemes based on single inheritance, multiple
                   inheritance, or mixins, all pose numerous problems for
                   reuse. To overcome these problems we propose traits,
                   pure units of reuse consisting only of methods. We
                   develop a formal model of traits that establishes how
                   traits can be composed, either to form other traits, or
                   to form classes. We also outline an experimental
                   validation in which we apply traits to refactor a
                   non-trivial application into composable units.},

                   specialization has been more difficult. This has been

  abstract       = {One of the key challenges of dynamic analysis
                   approaches is that they imply a huge volume of data,
                   thus making it difficult to extract high level views.
                   In this paper we describe a novel approach to trace
                   summarization by visually representing entire traces as
                   signals in time. Our technique produces a visualization
                   of the complete feature space of a system that fits on
                   one page. The focus of our work is to visually
                   represent individual traces feature behavior. We assume
                   a one-to-one mapping between features and traces. We
                   apply the approach on a case study, and discuss how our
                   visualization supports the reverse engineer to identify
                   patterns in traces of features. Moreover, we show how
                   the visual analysis of our trace signals reveals that
                   assumed one-to-one mappings between features and traces
                   may be flawed.},

  abstract       = { Classical module systems support well the modular
                   development of applications but do not offer the
                   ability to add or replace a method in a class that is
                   not defined in that module. On the other hand,
                   languages that support method addition and replacement
                   do not provide a modular view of applications, and
                   their changes have a global impact. The result is a gap
                   between module systems for object-oriented languages on
                   one hand, and the very desirable feature of method
                   addition and replacement on the other hand. To solve
                   these problems we present classboxes, a module system
                   for object-oriented languages that provides method
                   addition and replacement. Moreover, the changes made by
                   a classbox are only visible to that classbox (or
                   classboxes that import it), a feature we call local
                   rebinding. To validate the model, we have implemented
                   it in the Squeak Smalltalk environment, and performed
                   experiments modularising code. },

  abstract       = {A major aim of transactional distributed programming
                   environments is to facilitate the development of
                   reliable distributed applications by shielding the
                   developer from concerns such as failures. This paper
                   describes the linguistic features of the Hermes/ST
                   object-oriented distributed programming environment
                   that further ease the development of such applications
                   by enhancing the flexibility and extendibility of their
                   implementations. This is achieved through the
                   parameterisation of properties such as permanence,
                   concurrency, transactional semantics and distribution.
                   Parameterisation supports reuse, and enables the notion
                   of incremental development, whereby a simple
                   centralized sequential prototype of the application can
                   be easily validated before being gradually extended to
                   the final efficient reliable distributed application.
                   An example application is included to demonstrate this
                   approach.},

                   projects develop large test suites to ensure that the
                   system is behaving as expected. Not only do tests
                   ensure correctness, but they also offer a live
                   documentation for the code. However, as the system
                   evolves, the tests need to evolve as well to keep up
                   with the system, and as the test suite grows larger,
                   the effort invested into maintaining tests is a
                   significant activity. In this context, the quality of
                   tests becomes an important issue, as developers need to
                   assess and understand the tests they have to maintain.
                   In this paper we present TestLint, an approach together
                   with an experimental tool for qualifying tests. We
                   define a set of criteria to determine test quality, and
                   we evaluate our approach on a large sample of unit
                   tests found in open-source projects.},

                   reflective prototype-based language, the interpreter of
                   which is written in Scheme. Moostrap is based on a
                   reduced number of primitives, according to a previous
                   work for defining a taxonomy for prototype-based
                   languages. Our purpose is to reify the behavior of any
                   object through two steps: the slot lookup and its
                   application. The first phase is reified thanks to
                   \fIbehavioral metaobjects\fR, and the second is managed
                   by special objects, called \fIslot-executants\fR. This
                   kernel does not handle any implicit delegation at
                   first. However, we introduce it, as s first extension
                   of the basic language using a new behavioral
                   meta-object.},

                   computations at a high-level of abstraction, allowing

                   This paper presents the OOPAL model that enhances
                   object-oriented programming with array programming
                   features. The goal of OOPAL is to determine a minimum
                   set of modifications that must be made to the
                   traditional object model in order to take advantage of
                   the possibilities of array programming. It is based on
                   a minimal extension of method invocation and the
                   definition of a kernel of methods implementing the
                   fundamental array programming operations. The model is
                   validated in F-SCRIPT, a new scripting language.},

                   large monolithic applications with sets of smaller
                   software components, whose particular functionality and
                   interoperation can be adapted to users' needs. However,
                   the adaptation mechanisms of component software are
                   still limited. Most proposals concentrate on
                   adaptations that can be achieved either at compile time
                   or at link time. Current support for dynamic component
                   adaptation, i.e. unanticipated, incremental
                   modifications of a component system at run-time, is not
                   sufficient. This paper proposes object-based
                   inheritance (also known as delegation) as a complement
                   to purely forwarding-based object composition. It
                   presents a type-safe integration of delegation into a
                   class-based object model and shows how it overcomes the
                   problems faced by for\-warding-based component
                   interaction, how it supports independent extensibility
                   of components and unanticipated, dynamic component

  abstract       = {Distributed systems have become a buzz word, well
                   known but not well used, because of different existing
                   paradigms for programming languages, systems,
                   communication, coop eration, management, and because of
                   integraton problems. From the programmer's point of
                   view, the interesting question is how one can solve a
                   problem specification in a distributed environment.
                   Most of the existing distributed programming
                   environments concentrate on two levels; First, the
                   denotation of an operational solution in a modularized
                   way, and second, description of an initial
                   interconnection of these modules into a distributed
                   application, i.e. configuration or structural
                   programming. Both levels are kept independent as far as
                   possible, using different notations and thus can not
                   benefit from each other because of their separation.
                   This paper introduces a model which integrates
                   structural and operational programming into a single
                   paradigm. This paradigm is based on object-orientation
                   and reflective programming extended by a category and
                   annotation model realizing structural programming
                   support.},

  abstract       = {Knowing where to start reverse engineering a large
                   software system, when no information other than the
                   system`s source code itself is available, is a daunting
                   task. Having the history of the code (i.e., the
                   versions) could be of help if this would not imply
                   analyzing a huge amount of data. In this paper we
                   present an approach for identifying candidate classes
                   for reverse engineering and reengineering efforts. Our
                   solution is based on summarizing the changes in the
                   evolution of object-oriented software systems by
                   defining history measurements. Our approach, named
                   Yesterday`s Weather, is an analysis based on the
                   retrospective empirical observation that classes which
                   changed the most in the recent past also suffer
                   important changes in the near future. We apply this
                   approach on two case studies and show how we can obtain
                   an overview of the evolution of a system and pinpoint
                   its classes that might change in the next versions.},

                   mehreren Jahren verschiedene Applikationen, die in
                   Grossbanken f\"ur den Wertschriftenhandel eingesetzt
                   werden. FORUMsystems ist eine dieser Applikationen und
                   dient als Handelsplattform f\"ur B\"orsenh\"andler. Im
                   Rahmen der Produktpalette von FORUMsystems wurde eine
                   finanzmathematische Bibliothek in C++ geschaffen,
                   welche die n\"otigen Bewertungsfunktionen bereitstellt.
                   In der Finanzmathematik werden Kurven verwendet um die
                   aktuellen Marktverh\"altnisse zu modellieren. Sie
                   dienen als Input f\"ur theoretische Bewertungen und
                   nehmen daher eine zentrale Aufgabe in der
                   Entscheidungsunterst\"utzung im Handelsbereich einer
                   Bank ein. In der finanzmathematischen Bibliothek von
                   FORUMsystems stehen Kurven f\"ur die Bewertung zur
                   Verf\"ugung und werden auch f\"ur die Berechnung von
                   theoretischen Kursen verwendet. Die Bestimmung
                   (Interpolation) dieser Kurven erfolgt allerdings
                   ausserhalb dieser Bibliothek, da die entsprechenden
                   Algorithmen in Mathematica entwickelt wurden. Dazu wird
                   ein direkter Link zwischen den FORUM-Clients und dem
                   Mathematica-Kernel verwendet. Ziel dieses Projektes ist
                   nun die Bestimmung der Kurven ebenfalls in die
                   finanzmathematische C++-Bibliothek zu integrieren.
                   Damit w\"are der direkte Link von den einzelnen Clients
                   zum Mathematica-Kernel nicht mehr n\"otig, und es kann
                   mit einem deutlichen Performancegewinn gerechnet

                   containment graphs, and diverse patterns of dynamic
                   interaction all contribute to difficulties in
                   understanding, reusing, debugging, and tuning large
                   object-oriented systems. These difficulties may have a
                   significant impact on the usefulness of such systems.
                   Tools that help in understanding the contents and
                   behaviour of an object-oriented environment should play
                   a major role in reducing such difficulties. Such tools
                   allow for the exploration of different aspects of a
                   software environment such as inheritance structures,
                   part-of relationships, etc. However, object-oriented
                   systems differ in many respects from traditional
                   database systems, and in particular, conventional
                   querying mechanisms used in databases show poor
                   performance when used for the exploration of
                   objectoriented environments. This chapter defines the
                   requirements for effective exploration mechanisms in
                   the realm of object-oriented environments. We propose
                   an approach to browsing based on the notion of affinity
                   that satisfies such requirements. Our tool, the
                   affinity browser, provides a visual representation of
                   object relationships presented in terms of affinity.
                   Objects that appear closer in the visual representation
                   are more strongly related than objects lying farther
                   apart. So, the intensity of a relationship is
                   translated into distance in the visual representation
                   that provides the support for user navigation. We
                   provide many examples of metrics defined over the
                   objects of an environment to illustrate how object
                   relationships can be translated in terms of affinity so
                   that they can be used for the exploration of an
                   environment.},

  abstract       = {Many of the approaches that analyze software evolution
                   consider a static perspective of a system. Static
                   analysis approaches focus on the evolution of static
                   software entities such as packages, classes and
                   methods. Without knowledge of the roles software
                   entities play in system features, it is difficult to
                   interpret the motivation behind changes and extensions
                   in the code. To tackle this problem, we propose an
                   approach to software evolution analysis that exploits
                   the relationships between features and software
                   entities. Our definition of a feature is a unit of
                   observable behavior of a software system. We define
                   history measurements that summarize the evolution of
                   software entities from a feature perspective. We show
                   how we use our feature perspective of software
                   evolution to interpret modifications and extensions to
                   the code. We apply our approach on two case studies and
                   discuss our findings.},

                   parallel) systems because they need to deal with
                   failures, not just concurrency. Transactions are a way
                   of masking the distributed nature of a computation at
                   the programming language level by transforming all
                   failures into aborted transactions. If a communication
                   link goes down or a node crashes, the transaction
                   simply aborts. Users may try again later to rerun their
                   computation, but they are at least guaranteed that the
                   system is left in some consistent state. Transactions
                   are a well-known and fundamental control abstraction
                   that arose out of the database community. They have
                   three properties that distinguish them from normal
                   sequential processes: (1) A transaction is a sequence
                   of operations that is performed atomically
                   ("all-or-nothing"). If it completes successfully, it
                   commits ; otherwise, it aborts ; (2) concurrent
                   transactions are serializable (appear to occur
                   one-at-a-time), supporting the principle of isolation;
                   and (3) effects of committed transactions are
                   persistent (survive failures).},

  abstract       = {Given the importance of encapsulation to
                   object-oriented programming, it is surprising to note
                   that mainstream object-oriented languages offer only
                   limited and fixed ways of encapsulating methods.
                   Typically one may only address two categories of
                   clients, users and heirs, and one must bind visibility
                   and access rights at an early stage. This can lead to
                   inflexible and fragile code as well as clumsy
                   workarounds. We propose a simple and general solution
                   to this problem in which encapsulation policies can be
                   specified separately from implementations. As such they
                   become first-class composable entities that can be
                   reused by different classes. We present a detailed
                   analysis of the problem with encapsulation and
                   visibility mechanisms in mainstream OO languages, we
                   introduce our approach in terms of a simple model, and
                   we evaluate how our approach compares with existing
                   approaches. We also assess the impact of incorporating
                   encapsulation policies into Smalltalk and discuss some
                   implementation issues. },

                   important activity in the development and reengineering
                   of large object-oriented systems. Packages represent
                   the coarse-grained structure of an application. They
                   are artefacts to deploy and structure software, and
                   therefore more than a simple generalization of classes.
                   The relationships between packages and their contained
                   classes are key in the decomposition of an application
                   and its (re)-modularisation. However, it is difficult
                   to quickly grasp the structure of a package and to
                   understand how a package interacts with the rest of the
                   system. We tackle this problem using butterfly
                   visualizations, i.e. dedicated radar charts built from
                   simple package metrics based on a language-independent

  abstract       = {The availability of affordable fast graphics hardware
                   will have a strong impact on the way people deal with
                   information. Highly interactive interfaces relying on
                   fast 2-dimensional bitmap operations, and fast
                   3-dimensional image synthesis will soon become
                   available. This paper explores some new representation
                   techniques based on fast graphics primitives. The first
                   technique relies on fast a chanel operations to
                   visualize multiple representation layers
                   simultaneously. Each layer being translucent allows to
                   see layers that lay behind it. The second technique is
                   based on fast 3-dimensional image synthesis. The idea
                   is that a virtual camera allows for the visualization
                   of a world. The camera is controlled by a fuzzy
                   controller to which the user can specify its interests
                   with fuzzy logic rules based on linguistic variables.
                   This technique is well suited for the visualisation of
                   real time financial data.},

  abstract       = {CORBA (The Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
                   has to continually evolve in order to cope with the
                   changes of requirement of applications which become
                   larger and more distributed. For this reason new
                   features are being added to the CORBA specification,
                   for instance the last proposal for a revised CORBA
                   Messaging Service includes two new asynchronous models
                   of request invocation. Since these new features will be
                   added in the next CORBA implementations a relevant
                   issue is to study their operational behaviour from
                   different perspectives in order to facilitate the task
                   of implementors. This paper addresses this issue
                   providing an analysis of the CORBA Messaging Service
                   which includes the new asynchronous features. In
                   particular we illustrate how CORBA models for request
                   invocation can be mapped into a message passing
                   architecture based on the actor model. For this purpose
                   we exploit an algebra of actors which supports some of
                   the main features of the abstract Object Model of the
                   Object Management Group, such as object identity and an
                   explicit notion of state. This approach allows us to
                   discuss and compare different models of request
                   invocation in a standard process algebraic perspective
                   for instance we show how different notions of
                   equivalence, such as standard and asynchronous
                   bisimulation, can be adapted to reason about CORBA.},

                   structure of the system reveals only half of the
                   picture, since the structure tells us only how the code
                   is working but not what the code is about. What the
                   code is about can be found in the semantics of the
                   source code: names of identifiers, comments etc. In
                   this paper, we analyze how these terms are spread over
                   the source artifacts using Latent Semantic Indexing, an
                   information retrieval technique. We use the assumption
                   that parts of the system that use similar terms are
                   related. We cluster artifacts that use similar terms,
                   and we reveal the most relevant terms for the computed
                   clusters. Our approach works at the level of the source
                   code which makes it language independent. Nevertheless,
                   we correlated the semantics with structural information
                   and we applied it at different levels of abstraction
                   (e.g. classes, methods). We applied our approach on
                   three large case studies and we report the results we

  abstract       = {We propose to extend the CORBA interface definition of
                   distributed objects by a behavioral specification based
                   on high level Petri nets. This technique allows
                   specifying in an abstract, concise and precise way the
                   behavior of CORBA servers, including internal
                   concurrency and synchronization. As the behavioral
                   specification is fully executable, this approach also
                   enables early prototyping and testing of a distributed
                   object system as soon as the behaviors of individual
                   objects have been defined. The paper discusses several
                   implementation issues of the multithreaded, distributed
                   interpreter built for that purpose. The high level of
                   formality of the chosen formalism allows for
                   mathematical analysis of behavioral specifications.},

                   object-based programs written in a simple programming
                   language named A1. The proof system uses a

                   Hoare-style assertions. The syntax and formal semantics

                   given. A formal semantics of correctness formulas (for
                   partial corretness) is then defined. Axiom schemes and
                   proof rules associated with commands of A1, which
                   compose a proof system named P1, are presented. Example
                   are shown where these axioms schemes and proof rules

                   system P1 is shown to be sound according to the given

                   simple set of principles: object-centered
                   representation, dynamic reshape of objects, cloning and
                   possibly message delegation. However, they all differ
                   in the interpretation and combination of these
                   principles. Therefore there is a need to compare and
                   understand. In this paper we present Prototalk, a
                   research and teaching vehicle to understand, implement
                   and compare prototype-based languages. Prototalk is a
                   framework that offers a predefined set of language data
                   structures and mechanisms that can be composed and
                   extended to generate various prototype-based language
                   interpreters. It presents a classification of languages

                   major concern in software industry because of their
                   sheer size and complexity. This problem needs to be
                   tackled, since the systems in question are of
                   considerable worth to their owners an d maintainers. In
                   this article we present the concept of a polymetric
                   view, a lightweight software visualization technique
                   enriched with software metrics information. Polymetric
                   views help to understand the structure and detect
                   problems of a software syst em in the initial phases of
                   a reverse engineering process. We discuss the benefits
                   and limits of several predefined polymetric views we
                   have implemented in our tool CodeCrawler. Moreover,
                   based on clusters of different polymetric views we have
                   developed a methodology which supports and guides a
                   software engineer in the first phases of a reverse
                   engineering of a large software system. We have refined
                   this methodology by repeatedly applying it on
                   industrial systems, and illustrate it by applying a
                   selection of polymetric views to a case study.},

                   Although we are faced with new challenges posed by
                   enormous advances in hardware and internet technology,
                   we continue to struggle with old-fashioned languages

                   dynamic languages that support a view of programming as
                   constant evolution of living and open software models.
                   Such languages would require features such as dynamic
                   first-class namespaces, explicit meta-models, optional,
                   pluggable type systems, and incremental compilation of

                   garbage collection that may be used to reclaim
                   inaccessible resources in decentralized persistent
                   object based systems. Schemes for object addressing and
                   object identification are discussed and a proposal is
                   made which handles volatile objects separately from
                   persistent objects. The garbage collection of the space
                   of volatile objects is decoupled from the garbage
                   collection of the space of persistent objects. The
                   first kind of garbage collection can avoid the
                   complexity and overhead of a distributed algorithm by
                   classifying "exported" objects as persistent. The
                   problem of detecting and collecting "distributed
                   garbage" is then deferred to garbage collection of
                   persistent objects.},

                   information is multiplied by the number of versions of
                   the system one wants to understand. To counter this
                   problem we have come up with a flexible query engine
                   which can perform queries on the different versions of
                   a system. In this paper we give an outlook on our
                   current work in the field of software evolution and
                   focus particularly on the concepts behind the query
                   engine we have built.},

                   open systems are generally con current, distributed and

                   approaches to specifying component frameworks can lead

                   to develop a rigorous foundation for composable
                   software systems by a series of experiments in
                   modelling concurrent and object-based software
                   abstractions as composable, communicating processes.
                   Eventually we hope to identify and realize the most

                   construct that allow groups of methods to be named and
                   reused in arbitrary places in an inheritance hierarchy.
                   Classes can use methods from traits as well as defining
                   their own methods and instance variables. Traits thus
                   enable a new style of programming, in which traits
                   rather than classes are the primary unit of reuse.
                   However, the additional sub-structure provided by
                   traits is always optional: a class written using traits
                   can also be viewed as a flat collection of methods,
                   with no change in its semantics. This paper describes
                   the tool that supports these two alternate views of a
                   class, called the traits browser, and the programming
                   methodology that we are starting to develop around the

  abstract       = {Tuple spaces have turned out to be one of the most
                   fundamental abstractions for coordinating software
                   agents. They offer a simple and natural way of
                   communication and are capable to express a large class
                   of distributed and parallel algorithms. While many
                   extensions to the original Linda model have been
                   proposed, no one approach seems to be universally
                   applicable to all problem domains. In this thesis we
                   investigated how a tuple space can be extended to
                   support configurability of its behavior. In this way,
                   several variants of the coordination model can be
                   realized without changing the underlying base system.
                   Moreover, charging tasks to the coordination medium
                   allows a programmer to implement an application at any
                   desired level of abstraction. A prototype framework,
                   OPENSPACES, has been developed with the object-oriented
                   language Smalltalk. It supports both static
                   configurability as well as dynamic reconfiguration of
                   the behavior policies through runtime composition. To
                   be useful in open distributed systems, a coordination
                   medium must be capable of coordinating a variety of
                   different software entities. OPENSPACES therefore is
                   built on top of CORBA and provides access for
                   heterogeneous external clients. It can be used from any
                   platform using any programming language with a CORBA
                   implementation. The sole prerequisite for participating
                   in a OPENSPACES-based application is the implementation
                   of the small IDL interface. Hence not only the provided
                   standard clients, but any external software agent may
                   be coordinated. We present the framework and show with
                   a set of typical examples how it can be instantiated
                   and configured for different and changing needs. As an
                   example of a heterogeneous setup with external clients,
                   a Java agent has been developed to participate in one
                   of the example applications.},

                   examples, and describe implementation techniques that
                   yields efficiency comparable to dynamic object-oriented
                   language implementations considered to be high

                   the object system used in T, a dialect of Scheme. The

                   functions because they provide clients with continuing
                   services over time. They determine a \fImarriage
                   contract\fP for interactive services that cannot be
                   expressed by a pattern of time-independent \fIsales
                   contracts\fP. Objects express the
                   programming-in-the-large paradigm of software
                   engineering, while functions express the
                   programming-in-the-small paradigm of the analysis of
                   algorithms. Objects have a \fIfunctional semantics\fP
                   specified by their interface, a \fIserial semantics\fP
                   specified by traces of interface procedures, and a
                   \fIfully abstract semantics\fP that specifies behavior
                   over time for all possible interactions. They assign
                   meaning to the time between the execution of interface
                   procedures as well as to algorithmic effects. Church's
                   thesis that computable functions capture the intuitive
                   notion of effective computation for algorithms cannot
                   be extended to objects. Components are defined by
                   generalizing from accidental to necessary properties of
                   persistent interaction units. Scalability for software
                   problems, defined as ``asymptotic openness'', is shown
                   to be the analog of complexity for algorithmic
                   problems. Paradigms of interaction are examined for
                   functions and procedures, objects and processes, APIs
                   and frameworks, databases, GUIs, robots, and
                   virtual-reality systems. Early models of computing
                   stressed computation over interaction for both
                   theoretical reasons (greater tractability) and
                   practical reasons (there were no software components
                   with which to interact). However, scalable software
                   systems, personal computers, and databases require a
                   balance between algorithmic and interactive problem
                   solving. Models of interaction express the behavior of
                   actual software systems and therefore capture the
                   intuitive notion of truly effective computation more
                   completely than mere algorithms.},

                   the description of temporal aspects of object behaviour

                   collection of notions and concepts intended for the

                   sent to and received from an object. We also propose
                   notions for the description of the temporal order of
                   messages exchanged between cooperating objects related
                   with part-of relationships. Using propositional
                   temporal logic as the underlying formalism of our
                   approach, we show how to verify the consistency of
                   object specifications.},

                   programmer productivity through better reuse of
                   existing code. However, reuse is not yet pervasive in
                   today's object-oriented programs. Why is this so? We
                   argue that one reason is that current programming
                   languages and environments assume that components are
                   perfectly coordinated. Yet in a world where programs
                   are mostly composed out of reusable components, these
                   components are not likely to be completely integrated
                   because the sheer number of components would make
                   global coordination impractical. Given that seemingly
                   minor inconsistencies between individually designed
                   components would exist, we examine how they can lead to
                   integration problems with current programming language
                   mechanisms. We discuss several reuse mechanisms that
                   can adapt a component in place without requiring access
                   to the component's source code and without needing to
                   re-typecheck it.},

                   reengineering of large scale object-oriented systems.
                   However, due to the heterogeneity in today's
                   object-oriented programming languages, it is hard to
                   reuse reengineering tools across legacy systems. This
                   paper proposes a language independent exchange model,
                   so that tools may perform their tasks independent of
                   the underlying programming language. We have adopted
                   CDIF as the basis for the exchange of information,
                   using this model, between the reengineering tool
                   prototypes in the FAMOOS project. The main reasons for
                   adopting CDIF are, that firstly it is an industry
                   standard, and secondly it has a standard plain text
                   encoding which tackles the requirements of convenient
                   querying and human readability. Next to that the CDIF
                   framework supports the extensibility we need to define
                   our model and language plug-ins.},

                   Concept Analysis to analyse how methods and classes in
                   an object-oriented inheritance hierarchy are coupled by
                   means of the inheritance and interfaces relationships.
                   Especially for large and complex inheritance
                   hierarchies, we believe that a formal analysis of how
                   behaviour is reused can provide insight in how the
                   hierarchy was built and the different relationships
                   among the classes. To perform this analysis, we use
                   behavioural information provided by the self sends and
                   super sends made in each class of the hierarchy. The
                   proposed technique allows us to identify weak spots in
                   the inheritance hierarchy that may be improved, and to
                   serve as guidelines for extending or customising an

  abstract       = {A new calculus is presented for modelling
                   object-oriented constructs. The main features of the
                   calculus are: interaction by names, unification of
                   types and values, operators for combinations and
                   alternations of terms. With a limited set of syntactic
                   constructs a surprisingly large range of features can
                   be modelled, including not only object-oriented
                   constructs but also abstract data types, recursive and
                   dependent types and concurrency. The syntax and
                   operational semantics of the calculus are presented,
                   together with numerous programming examples. Through
                   comparisons with the lambda calculus, we argue that
                   interaction by names is fundamentally more expressive
                   than traditional functional abstraction and
                   application. In particular, it becomes possible to
                   treat the parameters of an abstraction independently
                   while doing a fixed-point operation, which is of great
                   convenience for modelling object-oriented systems.
                   Finally, an approach to type-checking is presented.
                   Although not totally mature yet, it shows how types and
                   values are merged in a single preorder over terms, and
                   how this preorder can be used to prevent type errors.},

                   mutation-based testing of software systems. Mutation
                   analysis is a powerful software testing technique that
                   evaluates the adequacy of test data based on its
                   ability to differentiate between the program under test
                   and its mutants, where mutants are constructed by
                   inserting single, simple errors into the program under
                   test. This evaluation process also provides guidance in
                   the creation of new test cases to provide more adequate
                   testing. Mothra consists of a collection of individual
                   tools, each of which implements a separate, independent
                   function for the testing system. The initial Mothra
                   tool set, for the most part, duplicates functionality
                   existing in previous mutation analysis systems. Current
                   efforts are concentrated on extending this basic tool
                   set to include capabilities previously unavailable to
                   the software testing community. The authors describe
                   Mothra tool set and extensions planned for the future},

                   artefact named Zypher. The scientific contribution of
                   this work is situated in the domain of object-oriented
                   software engineering. The contribution is a proper
                   combination of frameworks and meta-object protocols,
                   which are two promising techniques in object-oriented
                   software engineering. We show that, when combining both
                   approaches, explicit representations of framework
                   contracts are part of a meta-object protocol. This
                   insight is valuable in the design of meta-object

                   object-oriented database (OODB) systems. While existing
                   OODB systems provide for limited forms of evolution,
                   including modification to the database schema and
                   reorganization of affected instances, we find their
                   support insufficient. Specific deficiencies are 1) the
                   lack of compatibility support for old applications, and
                   2) the lack of ability to install arbitrary changes
                   upon the schema and database. This paper examines the
                   limitations of existing schemes, and offers a more
                   general framework for specifying and reasoning about
                   the evolution of class definitions and the adaptation

                   of the story. Flexible, configurable applications can
                   be viewed as collections of reusable objects conforming
                   to standard interfaces together with scripts that bind
                   these objects together to perform certain tasks.
                   Scripting encourages a component-oriented approach to
                   application development in which frameworks of reusable
                   components (objects and scripts) are carefully
                   engineered in an evolutionary software life-cycle, with
                   the ultimate goal of supporting application
                   construction largely from these interchangeable,
                   prefabricated components. The activity of constructing
                   the running application is supported by a visual
                   scripting tool that replaces the textual paradigm of
                   programming with a visual paradigm of direct
                   manipulation and editing of both application and user
                   interface components. We present scripting by means of
                   some simple examples, and we describe a prototype of a
                   visual scripting tool, called Vista. We conclude with
                   some observations on the environmental support needed
                   to support a component-oriented software life-cycle,
                   using as a specific example the application de
                   velopment environment of ITHACA, a large European
                   project of which Vista is a part.},

                   Properties can also be defined by recursion; a central

                   development and testing is a class. So understanding
                   how a class is defined and behaves is important.
                   Considering that a class is composed of instance
                   variables and methods, the process is not so easy to
                   achieve because we must decide which different
                   viewpoints can help us to detect features of a class.
                   These viewpoints can include identifying groups of
                   methods accessing a (set of) instance variable(s),
                   groups of methods that interact among themselves to
                   provide a functionality or groups of methods that
                   behave as interface. Thus, with these different groups,
                   we are able to know the different hidden
                   characteristics of a class. In this position paper, we
                   propose to apply Concept Analysis to generate the
                   different groups of (collaborating) entities and use
                   these groups to define different views. These views
                   will help us to get the main features of a class.},

                   the paradigm. We show that all the cultural aspects of

                   the object metaphor. In addition, we stress that the

                   Widening allows an object to be temporarily widened,
                   that is transformed into an instance of a subclass, a
                   wide class, and, later on, to be shrunk, that is
                   reshaped to its original class. Wide classes share the
                   main properties of plain classes: they have a name, a
                   superclass, they may be instantiated, they have an

                   may be used to override function definitions. Widening
                   is also useful to implement transient data storage for
                   long-lasting computations. In particular, it helps
                   reducing software data retention. This phenomenon
                   arises when the actual data structures used in a
                   program fail to reflect time-dependent properties of
                   values and can cause excessive memory consumption
                   during the execution. Wide classes may be implemented
                   for any dynamically-typed class-based programming
                   language with very few modifications to the existing
                   runtime system. We describe the simple and efficient
                   implementation strategy used in the Bigloo runtime
                   system. Keywords: language implementation, dynamic
                   inheritance, dynamic type checking, instance

                   the same components. COP allows things that OOP cannot

  abstract       = {Nowadays, object-oriented meta-languages such as MOF
                   (Meta- Object Facility) are increasingly used to
                   specify domain-specific languages in the model-driven
                   engineering community. However, these meta-languages
                   focus on structural specifications and have no built-in
                   support for specifications of operational semantics. In
                   this paper we explore the idea of using aspectoriented
                   modeling to add precise action specifications with
                   static type checking and genericity at the meta level,
                   and examine related issues and possible solutions. We
                   believe that such a combination would bring significant
                   benefits to the community, such as the specification,
                   simulation and testing of operational semantics of
                   metamodels. We present requirements for such
                   statically-typed meta-languages and rationales for the
                   aforementioned benefits.},

                   with the goal of limiting the scope of changes: if our
                   packages are cohesive, we hope that changes will be
                   limited to the packages responsible for the features we
                   are changing, or at worst the packages that are
                   immediate clients of those features. But how should we
                   measure cohesion? Traditional cohesion metrics focus on
                   the explicit dependencies and interactions between the
                   classes within the package under study. A package,
                   however, may be conceptually cohesive even though its
                   classes exhibit no explicit dependencies. We propose a
                   group of contextual metrics that assess the cohesion of
                   a package based on the degree to which its classes are
                   used together by common clients. We apply these metrics
                   to various case studies, and contrast the degree of
                   cohesion detected with that of traditional cohesion
                   metrics. In particular, we note that object-oriented
                   frameworks may appear not to be cohesive with
                   traditional metrics, whereas our contextual metrics
                   expose the implicit cohesion that results from the
                   framework's clients.},

  abstract       = {Virtual types have been proposed as a notation for
                   generic programming in object-oriented languages---an
                   alternative to the more familiar mechanism of
                   parametric classes. The tradeoffs between the two
                   mechanisms are a matter of current debate: for many
                   examples, both appear to offer convenient (indeed
                   almost interchangeable) solutions; in other situations,
                   one or the other seems to be more satisfactory.
                   However, it has proved difficult to draw rigorous
                   comparisons between the two approaches, partly because
                   current proposals for virtual types vary considerably
                   in their details, and partly because the proposals
                   themselves are described rather informally, usually in
                   the complicating context of full-scale language
                   designs. Work on the foundations of object-oriented
                   languages has already established a clear connection
                   between parametric classes and the polymorphic
                   functions found in familiar typed lambda-calculi. Our
                   aim here is to explore a similar connection between
                   virtual types and dependent records. We present, by
                   means of examples, a straightforward model of objects
                   with embedded type fields in a typed lambda-calculus
                   with subtyping, type operators, fixed points, dependent
                   functions, and dependent records with both ``bounded''
                   and ``manifest'' type fields (this combination of
                   features can be viewed as a measure of the inherent
                   complexity of virtual types). Using this model, we then
                   discuss some of the major differences between previous
                   proposals and show why some can be checked statically
                   while others require run-time checks. We also
                   investigate how the partial ``duality'' of virtual
                   types and parametric classes can be understood in terms
                   of translations between universal and (dependent)
                   existential types.},

                   will have considerable impact on the way people deal
                   with information. Highly interactive interfaces relying
                   on fast 2-dimensional bitmap operations, and fast
                   3-dimensional image synthesis are becoming available.
                   This paper explores some new representation techniques
                   based on fast graphics primitives. We present first
                   financial information radars as a flexible data
                   representation technique for financial information. The
                   concept of information radar takes inspiration on
                   traditional oscilloscopes and radars. Information
                   radars are 2D visualization tools that display multiple
                   superimposed translucent data representation layers.
                   Each representation layer being translucent allows the
                   layers that lay behind it to be seen. The radar
                   provides multiple interaction modes so that the user
                   can interact with the various layers either to modify
                   representations, to explore data relationships, or to
                   access other tools. Information radars rely on fast
                   a-channel operations to visualize multiple
                   representation layers simultaneously. The second data
                   representation technique is based on fast 3-dimensional
                   image synthesis. The idea is that a virtual camera
                   allows for the visualization of a virtual world
                   composed of objects that exhibit dynamic behaviours.
                   The camera is driven by a fuzzy controller to which
                   users can specify viewing interests expressed as rules
                   in terms of fuzzy logic linguistic variables. The fuzzy
                   controller drives the movement of the camera so that
                   the camera shows what the user expressed interest in.
                   This technique is particularly well suited for the
                   visualization of real time financial data.},

  abstract       = {The development of concurrent object-based programming
                   languages has suffered from the lack of any generally
                   accepted formal foundation for defining their
                   semantics. Therefore we are seeking for a minimal
                   semantic foundation for defining features of concurrent
                   object-based languages. Our previous work has shown
                   that the Pi-calculus is a promising formal foundation
                   for modelling objects, and we have defined an object
                   model integrating common features of object-oriented
                   programming languages. Our goal is to define a
                   black-box framework for modelling objects. As a first
                   extension of our Pi-calculus based object model, we
                   present in this work the integration of abstractions
                   for synchronizing concurrent objects. Our results show
                   that objects are most easily synchronized when
                   synchronization policies are reified as first class
                   entities (i.e. metaobjects) and that McHale's concept
                   of ``generic synchronization policies'' forms a
                   promising base for the definition of higher-level,
                   reusable synchronization abstractions.},

                   are represented by records and produced by
                   instantiating classes. The type system for objects uses

                   analysis is that inheritance of synchronization
                   constraints should take the form of incrementally {\em
                   more} restrictive constraints for derived subclasses.
                   Our conclusion is based on the view that combinations
                   of behavior in object-oriented languages yield
                   subclasses that {\em extend} superclass behavior. We
                   give a notation for describing synchronization
                   constraints. In our notation, synchronization
                   constraints can be inherited and aggregated. We present
                   a number of examples that illustrate the fundamental
                   concepts captured by our notation. Synchronization
                   constraints are described as restrictions that apply to
                   invocation of methods. Application of restrictions is
                   {\em pattern-based}, which allows the same restriction
                   to apply to multiple methods and multiple restrictions
                   to apply to the same method.},

  abstract       = {As software systems grow, reverse engineering is
                   becoming an increasingly important task. The larger the
                   system grows the more complex it becomes and the more
                   effort must be put in to understand it. Consequently,
                   the knowledge of the developers becomes more and more
                   critical for the process of understanding the system.
                   However, in large systems not all developers know about
                   the entire system. Thus, to make the best use of
                   developer knowledge, we need to know which developer is
                   knowledgeable in which part of it. This thesis aims to
                   provide a lightweight approach to understand how
                   developers changed the system, when and where they
                   worked and which developer owned which part of the

  abstract       = {The challenge facing the International Organization
                   for Standardization (ISO) in the early eighties, in
                   developing Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol
                   standards for network management, was to ensure that
                   such protocols should, on the one hand, be standardised
                   but, on the other, be capable of managing a myriad of
                   resource types. ISO met the challenge by developing a
                   single internationally-standardised carriage protocol
                   (CMIP), and tools to produce information models that
                   would reflect the resources being managed. Such an
                   approach makes it possible for the same carriage
                   protocol to carry management messages for many
                   different types of resources. In developing its
                   information modelling tools and services, ISO has
                   adopted an object-oriented approach: the resources to
                   be managed are modelled as managed objects or
                   aggregates of managed objects. The managed-object model
                   is similar to popular object-oriented
                   programming-language models but it includes a number of
                   features that reflect the special requirements of
                   network management. These requirements include:
                   asynchronous operation, active resources, a distributed
                   environment, compatibility, and feature optionality.
                   Fulfilling these requirements lead to the inclusion of
                   concepts such as event-notification, multiple
                   object-selection, packages, and allomorphism. The next
                   generation of network-management standards will need to
                   address the demands of large, multi-protocol, mutable
                   networks. How these requirements might affect the
                   evolution of the managed-object model and services is
                   considered.},

                   composition abstractions due to restricted abstraction
                   power. A number of approaches, like SOP or AOP overcome
                   this restriction, thus giving the programmer more
                   possibilities to get a higher degree of separation of
                   concern. We propose \emph{forms}, extensible mappings
                   from labels to values, as vehicle to implement and
                   reason about composition abstractions. Forms unify a
                   variety of concepts such as interfaces, environments,
                   and contexts. We are prototyping a composition language
                   where forms are the only and ubiquitous first class
                   value. Using forms, it is possible compose software
                   artifacts focusing on a single concern and thus achieve
                   a high degree of separation of concern. We believe that
                   using forms it also possible to compare and reason

  Title          = {Modeling Examples to Test and Understand Software},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {One of the oldest techniques to explain abstract
                   concepts is to provide concrete examples. By explaining
                   an abstract concept with a concrete example people make
                   sure that the concept is understood and remembered.
                   Examples in software can be used both to test the
                   software and to illustrate its functionality.
                   Object-oriented programs are built around the concepts
                   of classes, methods and variables, where methods are
                   the atoms of the functionality. But the meta-models of
                   object-oriented languages do not allow developers to
                   associate runnable and composable examples with these
                   concepts and particularly not with methods. Unit tests
                   on the other hand, assure the quality of the units
                   under test and document them. Not being integrated into
                   the language, unit tests are not linked explicitly to
                   their units under test which makes it unnecessarily dif
                   ficult to use them for documenting, typing and
                   debugging software. In addition they are not composable
                   making it hard to develop higher level test scenarios
                   in parallel with higher level objects. In this thesis
                   we analyze unit tests to learn about implicit
                   dependencies among tests and from tests to the methods
                   under test. We develop a technique to partially order
                   unit tests in terms of their covered methods, which
                   reveals possible redundancies due to the lack of
                   composability. We show how partial orders can be used
                   to debug and to comprehend software. We then develop a
                   taxonomy based on several case studies revealing that a
                   high fraction of unit tests already implicitly focuses
                   on single methods. We show that the rest of the tests
                   can be decomposed into commands focusing on single
                   methods. We build a meta-model based on our findings of
                   analyzing test interdependencies which establishes how
                   tests can be explicitly linked to their method under
                   test and how they can be composed to form higher-level
                   test scenarios. We explain how the problems of missing
                   links between tests and units under test are solved
                   using our meta-model. Furthermore, we implemented the
                   meta-model and a first user interface on top of it to
                   give first evidence of how our model supports the
                   developer.},

                   approach to help the extraction of architectural
                   information in the re-engineering process. Commonly,
                   the re-engineering life-cycle has been defined as a
                   succession of the following tasks: analysis of
                   requirements, model capture (understanding the system),
                   problem detection, problem analysis, reorganization and
                   change propagation. We have evaluated the benefit of a
                   prototyping approach with a focus on model capture.
                   Although prototyping is a known approach to evaluate
                   the application feasibility, costs, comparison and
                   validation of choices, we focus in this paper on the

  Title          = {Stateful Traits and their Formalization},

  Note           = {To appear},
  abstract       = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose
                   classes from reusable components while avoiding
                   problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance
                   and mixins. Traits as originally proposed are
                   stateless, that is, they contain only methods, but no
                   instance variables. State can only be accessed within
                   stateless traits by accessors, which become required
                   methods of the trait. Although this approach works
                   reasonably well in practice, it means that many traits,
                   viewed as software components, are artificially
                   \emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may
                   contain significant amounts of boilerplate glue code.
                   We present an approach to stateful traits that is
                   faithful to the guiding principle of stateless traits:
                   the client retains control of the composition. Stateful
                   traits consist of a minimal extension to stateless
                   traits in which instance variables are purely local to
                   the scope of a trait, unless they are explicitly made
                   accessible by the composing client of a trait. We
                   demonstrate by means of a formal object calculus that
                   adding state to traits preserves the flattening
                   property: traits contained in a program can be compiled
                   away. We discuss and compare two implementation
                   strategies, and briefly present a case study in which
                   stateful traits have been used to refactor the
                   trait-based version of the Smalltalk collection

                   better separation of concerns, such as aspect-oriented
                   programming, is a solid testimony of this fact.
                   Strangely enough, almost all proposals are formulated
                   in the context of {Java}, in which tool providers
                   encounter severe restrictions due to the rigidity of
                   the environment. This paper present ByteSurgeon, a
                   library to transform binary code in Smalltalk.
                   ByteSurgeon takes full advantage of the flexibility of
                   the Squeak environment to enable bytecode
                   transformation at runtime, thereby allowing dynamic,
                   on-the-fly modification of applications. ByteSurgeon
                   operates on bytecode in order to cope with situations
                   where the source code is not available, while providing
                   appropriate high-level abstractions so that users do
                   not need to program at the bytecode level. We
                   illustrate the use of ByteSurgeon via the
                   implementation of method wrappers and a simple MOP, and

                   fundamental mechanism for reuse in object-oriented
                   languages. Unfortunately, the main variants --- single
                   inheritance, multiple inheritance, and mixin
                   inheritance --- all suffer from conceptual and
                   practical problems related to software reuse and
                   robustness with respect to changes. In a rst part of
                   this thesis, we identify and illustrate these problems.
                   To overcome these problems, we then present traits, a
                   simple compositional model that extends single
                   inheritance. A trait is essentially a (parameterized)
                   set of methods; it serves as a behavioral building
                   block for classes and is the primitive unit of code
                   reuse. We develop a formal model of traits that
                   establishes how traits can be composed to form other
                   traits or classes, and we describe how we implemented
                   traits in Squeak Smalltalk by bootstrapping a new
                   language kernel. We present our experimental validation
                   in which we apply traits to refactor parts of the
                   Smalltalk kernel and library, and we develop a
                   programming methodology around the usage of traits and
                   the trait browser, the tool that we implemented to take
                   full advantage of the availability of traits in the
                   Squeak programming environment.},

                   classes (i.e., packages, modules, selector namespaces,
                   etc). To understand such diversity and to compare the
                   different approaches, a common foundation is needed. As
                   far as we are aware of, no major attempt that would go
                   in that direction has been realized. In this paper we
                   present a simple module calculus together with a set of
                   operators for modeling the composition semantics of
                   different grouping mechanisms. Using this module
                   calculus we are able to express the semantics of {Java}

                   namespaces, gbeta classes, classboxes, MZScheme units,

                   object-oriented programming is to exploit the software
                   reuse potential of object-oriented features in the
                   development of concurrent systems. Early attempts to
                   introduce concurrency to object-oriented languages
                   uncovered interferences between object-oriented and
                   concurrency features that limited the extent to which
                   the benefits of objectoriented programming could be
                   realized for developing concurrent systems. This has
                   fostered considerable research into languages and
                   approaches aiming at a graceful integration of
                   object-oriented and concurrent programming. We will
                   examine the issues underlying concurrent
                   object-oriented programming, examine and compare how

                   system yields vast amounts of information, making
                   accurate interpretations difficult. Filtering or
                   compression techniques are often applied to reduce the
                   volume of data without loss of key information vital
                   for a specific analysis goal. Alternatively,
                   visualization is generally accepted as a means of
                   effectively representing large amounts of data. The
                   challenge lies in creating effective and expressive
                   visual representations that not only allows for a
                   global picture, but also enables us to inspect the
                   details of the large data sets. We define the focus of
                   our analysis to be the runtime behavior of features.
                   Static structural visualizations of a system are
                   typically represented in two dimensions. We exploit a
                   third dimension to visually represent the dynamic
                   information, namely object instantiations and message
                   sends. We introduce a novel 3D visualization technique
                   that supports animation of feature behavior and
                   integrates zooming, panning, rotating and on-demand
                   details. As proof of concept, we apply our
                   visualization technique to feature execution traces of
                   an example system.},

                   published in the past years. Most of these approaches
                   need a pattern library as reference. Personal coding
                   style and domain specific requirements lead to creating
                   new patterns or adapting existing ones and make those
                   approaches fail. The second problem is that the found
                   patterns of those methods are presented without
                   connection to the other patterns. To gain an overview
                   of the whole system and its mechanisms, we propose to
                   set the patterns in relation each other. Our work shows
                   a method to detect Software Patterns using Formal
                   Concept Analysis (FCA). The advantage of this approach
                   is that no reference library is needed and the results
                   are set in relation each other. FCA is a mathematical
                   theory which detects the presence of groups of classes
                   which instantiate a common, repeated pattern. Those
                   found patterns are presented in a lattice, a partial
                   order relation among the patterns, which allows us to
                   explore the pattern which are in relation to them. We
                   implemented a prototype tool ConAn PaDi which navigates
                   with the Fish Eye View technique over the patterns. For
                   validation we applied this tool to three mid-sized
                   Smalltalk applications},

  abstract       = {Tracking the evolution of a software system through
                   time gives us valuable information. It suggests which
                   parts are likely to remain stable and which 'problem'
                   aspects are likely to change, and it gives us insight
                   into some of the design choices made. In this paper we
                   show how recovered views of succesive versions of the
                   same software system can be used to track evolution. We
                   first briefly describe our approach for recovering
                   views of software applications. We then compare views
                   of two versions of the HotDraw framework. Our objective
                   is to illustrate a number of issues concerning
                   architectural evolution: what is architectural change
                   as opposed to change in general? how can we detect
                   architectural drift? how can we evaluate the relative
                   quality of different architectural solutions? what are
                   guidelines for building evolvable software?},

                   structuring classes. Traits support the reuse of method
                   collections over several classes. However, traits
                   cannot be used when specifying unanticipated changes to
                   an application. On the other hand, classboxes are a new
                   module system that supports the local redefinition of
                   classes: a collection of classes can be locally
                   extended with variables and/or methods and the existing
                   clients do not get impacted by changes. However, an
                   extension applied to a class by a classbox cannot be
                   reused for other classes. This paper describes how
                   combining Traits and Classboxes supports the safe
                   introduction of crosscutting collaborations: safe
                   because the existing clients of the classes do not get
                   impacted, crosscutting because collaborations between
                   several classes can be put in place in a unanticipated
                   manner. In the resulting system, a collaboration is
                   represented by a classbox and a role by a trait.},

  School         = {University of Bern},
  Type           = {Diploma Thesis},
  abstract       = {Software Reengineering is a main issue in software
                   industry. One of its main activities, reverse
                   engineering, is concerned with trying to understand a
                   software system and how it ticks. For the investigation
                   and graphical representation of large and complex
                   systems there are various tools for automated support.
                   However, the information extraction with these tools is
                   di cult, visualising certain aspects of a software
                   system may overwhelm the observer with its complexity.
                   We discuss in this work an object-oriented reverse
                   engineering approach using grouping. The intention of
                   grouping is to create groups with components of a
                   software system. The use of grouping has many benefits
                   for a reverse engineer: it supports the program
                   understanding and the design recovery, it adds higher
                   abstraction levels to the system, and it permits to
                   create di erent representations as well as alternate
                   views of a system. Furthermore, the use of groups and
                   the scalability of grouping are effective in reducing
                   the complexity of large systems. All the information we
                   need to create groups is found in the software system.
                   User-defined queries on the system perform the
                   selection of components for the creation of new groups.
                   We introduce the visualisation of groups and show their
                   usefulness with a Smalltalk case study.},

                   increasingly important technique for integrating
                   systems. However, the use of this technique has largely
                   been confined to tool integration systems---in which
                   tools exist as independent processes---and special
                   purpose languages---in which specialized forms of event
                   broadcast are designed into the language from the
                   start. This paper broadens the class of systems that
                   can benefit from this approach by showing how to
                   augment general-purpose programming languages with
                   facilities for implicit invocation. We illustrate the
                   approach in the context of three different languages,
                   Ada, C++, and Common Lisp. The intent is to highlight
                   the key design considerations that arise in extending
                   such languages with implicit invocation.},

  abstract       = {Many (web) applications share content between several
                   users and different views. To manage this content often
                   a CMS (Content Management System) is used with
                   different levels of access and offer possibilities to
                   edit and change the content. Only a few systems have a
                   security system, which can adapt to changing
                   requirements with another type of security model.
                   Therefore the way access is permitted or denied is
                   fixed in the architecture and the evolution progress of
                   the application. In detail this means that the part of
                   authorization and authentication is often hard-wired
                   into the application and bigger changes to the
                   structure in the application are required to implement
                   for example another policy. Typically the actual
                   implementation of the security system fits the current
                   wishes of the users or developers and is a fixed part
                   of the application and therefore not very easy to
                   exchange nor to adapt a new policy. The proposed
                   pluggable authentication and authorization framework
                   (called JPAAM) offers a solution to this problem and
                   allows users to select their security model for their
                   needs and gives developers the possibility to develop
                   an application aside the aspect of authorization and
                   authentication. JPAAM provides highly configurable
                   interfaces with which a clear separation of the
                   security system from the application is possible.},

                   have been proposed over the years, but still today
                   there is only partial agreement over such basic issues
                   as granularity (are components bigger or smaller than
                   objects, packages, or application?), instantiation (do
                   components exist at run-time or only at compile-time?),
                   and state (should we distinguish between components and
                   ``instances" of components?). We adopt a minimalist
                   view in which components can be distinguished by
                   \emph{composable interfaces}. We have identified a
                   number of key features and mechanisms for expressing
                   composable software, and propose a calculus for
                   modeling components, based on the asynchronous pi
                   calculus extended with explicit namespaces, or
                   ``forms". This calculus serves as a semantic foundation
                   and an executable abstract machine for Piccola, an
                   experimental composition language. The calculus also
                   enables reasoning about compositional styles and
                   evaluation strategies for Piccola. We present the
                   design rationale for the Piccola calculus, and briefly
                   outline some of the results obtained.},

                   problems in the context of software evolution. Current
                   approaches reduce this complexity by filtering out
                   irrelevant information. In this paper we propose an
                   approach based on a combination of software
                   visualization and software metrics, as software
                   visualization is apt for complexity reduction and
                   metrics introduce the possibility to qualify evolution.
                   We discuss a simple and effective way to visualize the
                   evolution of software systems which helps to recover
                   the evolution of object oriented software systems. In
                   addition we define a vocabulary that qualifies some
                   specific situations that occurs when considering system
                   evolution. },

  abstract       = {In the context of the FAMOOS project it is necessary
                   to transfer object-oriented models of software systems
                   between different analysis tools. These models conform
                   to the meta-model FAMIX, which is a model of the source
                   code of a software system. In this project the OMG
                   standard XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) is used to map
                   the FAMIX meta-model to an XML DTD and generate XML
                   files based on the model that is transferred. Because
                   XMI is based on MOF (Meta Object Facility) meta-models,
                   FAMIX is defined as a MOF meta-model. Based on these
                   concepts, a prototype in Java is implemented that reads
                   data from the Java reflective-interface and uses the
                   XMI standard to generate an XML document. Because any
                   model that has a MOF compliant metamodel can be
                   exchanged with XMI, the prototype uses a generic
                   approach by implementing the MOF interfaces and
                   instantiating the FAMIX meta-model from the MOF model.
                   This architecture can be reused for systems that use
                   meta-models different from FAMIX. In order to test the
                   correctness of the model-data after the transfer, a
                   test program is implemented, that verifies the syntax
                   and the content of generated XMI documents.},

  abstract       = {The inheritance anomaly refers to the serious
                   difficulty in combining inheritance and concurrency in
                   a simple and satisfactory way within a concurrent
                   object-oriented language. The problem is closely
                   connected with the need to impose synchronization
                   constraints on the acceptance of a message by an
                   object. In most concurrent object-oriented languages
                   this synchronization is achieved by synchronization
                   code controlling the acceptance of messages by objects.
                   Synchronization code is often hard to inherit and tends
                   to require extensive redefinitions. The solutions that
                   have appeared so far in the literature to alleviate
                   this problem seem to implicitly assume that better,
                   more reusable, mechanisms are needed to create and
                   structure synchronization code. The approach taken in
                   this paper is to consider the inheritance anomaly as a
                   problem caused by the very presence of synchronization
                   code. The goal is then to completely eliminate
                   synchronization code. This is achieved by using
                   order-sorted rewriting logic, an abstract model of
                   concurrent computation that is machine-independent and
                   extremely fine grain, and that can be used directly to
                   program concurrent object-oriented systems. Our
                   proposed solution involves a distinction between two
                   different notions of inheritance, a type-theoretic one
                   called class inheritance, and a notion called module
                   inheritance that supports reuse and modification of
                   code. These two different notions address two different
                   ways in which the inheritance anomaly can appear; for
                   each of them we propose declarative solutions in which
                   no explicit synchronization code is ever used.},

                   on method traces. However, in the case of
                   object-orientation understanding program execution by
                   analyzing method traces is complicated because the
                   behavior of a program depends on the sharing and the
                   transfer of object references (aliasing). We argue that
                   trace-based dynamic analysis is at a too low level of
                   abstraction for object-oriented systems. We propose a
                   new approach that captures the life cycle of objects by
                   explicitly taking into account object aliasing and how
                   aliases propagate during the execution of the program.

                   an associated intensity. The user is presented with a

                   hypermedia environment where objects lying close
                   together have a greater affinity than those lying

                   allowing modification of the underlying measure of
                   affinity. The system is also able to track dynamically
                   the evolution of the objects' relationships. Based on
                   the affinity concept, we develop new dynamic

                   evolution and maintenance phases of a system, the
                   developer has to be able to understand how these
                   dependencies were defined and how they influence the
                   interaction of the artifacts. The developer must be
                   sure that modifications done in the system will not
                   break its behavior. In the most of the cases, this
                   happens because the dependencies are not documented. We
                   propose to tackle this problem in the context of object
                   oriented classes hierarchies using Concept Analysis. We
                   use different properties about invocations in methods
                   to analyze the dependencies among the hierarchy classes
                   in terms of class behaviour. Based on these results, we
                   show a set of patterns that describe repeated kinds of
                   behavior in class hierarchies. We show the application
                   of these patterns in the specific case of Magnitude
                   hierarchy in Smalltalk.},

                   on the Meta-level},

  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {Inter-language bridging is an important issue of
                   scripting language design and implementation. Most of
                   the popular languages such as Python, Perl, Tcl, and
                   Ruby use a bridging approach based on wrappers that are
                   written in the external language (usually C/C++) and
                   serve as a glue layer between the languages. This
                   allows a wide flexibility in defining the glue
                   abstractions, but it requires the user to specify them
                   on the level of the implementation language, and it
                   therefore impairs the higher-level scripting process.
                   In contrast, the first implementations of JPiccola, a
                   scripting and composition language implemented in
                   {Java}, use a generic bridging strategy based on
                   information provided by {Java}'s runtime introspection
                   facilities. This strategy makes accessing of external
                   objects more lightweight, but it does not provide the
                   necessary means of abstraction and leads to a very
                   tight coupling between the two language levels. In this
                   thesis, we present a new bridging strategy for Piccola
                   that combines the advantages of the two approaches. We
                   minimize the bridging functionality that is hardcoded
                   in the virtual machine by making it a meta-aspect of
                   the language Piccola. This allows the programmer to use
                   the unrestricted expressive power of the scripting
                   language to specify the glue abstractions at a higher
                   level and adapt them dynamically. As a second
                   contribution, we present a lazy evaluation technique
                   that significantly reduces the performance overhead
                   introduced by the meta-level bridging layer. In order
                   to apply this lazy evaluation technique to Piccola
                   services in general, we develop a partial evaluation
                   algorithm that separates the side effects of a service
                   and turns the individual expressions into closures.
                   Finally, we give an overview of SPiccola, a
                   Squeak-based Piccola implementation with thread-aware
                   debugging tools.},

  abstract       = {A lot of routine office tasks (e.g., processing an
                   order in a retail company) can be described as
                   structured recurring tasks (called \fIprocedures\fR)
                   whose basic items (called \fIactivities\fR) must be
                   performed by various persons and computers (called
                   \fIactors\fR) in a certain order (sequential or
                   parallel). Inside a procedure, the coordination between
                   actors in different places is asynchronous and is
                   characterized by the circulation of folders, forms or
                   papers. Many procedures can spread over several weeks.
                   \fIWoorks\fR is an object-oriented workflow system
                   designed to assist organizations in defining,
                   executing, coordinating, and monitoring workflow
                   procedures based on a shared environment. WooRKS
                   architecture relies on an object oriented database
                   management system upon which all the objects are
                   represented and supported by a UNIX (TM) server, and
                   clients distributed through TCP/IP protocol runing
                   Microsoft Windows (TM) or OSF/Motif (TM). WooRKS
                   incorporates several interrelated models that can be
                   used together or separately: an \fIorganization
                   model\fR for specifying the actors, an \fIinformation
                   module\fR for defining information to be handled, a
                   \fItime model\fR for controlling when actions must be
                   executed, an \fIoperator model\fR for implementing
                   atomic operations on information, and a \fIprocedure
                   model\fR for combining together these various
                   components. Through the use of object oriented
                   technologies, WooRKs provides: a comprehensive system
                   to design, implement and administrate workflow
                   applications; a consistent set of high-level formalisms
                   to describe a workflow application; a powerful
                   organizational model; extensive time and external
                   management utilities; a graphical editor for the
                   workflow procedure definition; easy integration with
                   existing office applications; an informative and
                   consistent end user interface; discretionary security
                   control; and high reusability of software components
                   enabling quick delivery of customer-specified workflow
                   applications.},

                   defined as a named query expression, and queries issued
                   against views can be translated into equivalent queries
                   against databases by means of the query modification

                   constant challenge in such environments to ensure that
                   software components are safely composed in the face of
                   changing dependencies and incomplete knowledge. To
                   address this problem, we propose a new kind of type
                   system which allows us to infer not only the type
                   provided by a software component in an open system, but
                   also the type it requires of its environment, subject
                   to certain constraints. The contractual type we infer
                   for components can then be statically checked when
                   components are composed. To illustrate our approach, we
                   introduce the form calculus, a calculus of explicit
                   environments, and we present a type system that infers
                   types for form expressions.},

                   and adapt features of an application in response to
                   changing requirements. The problem is that just by
                   reading the source code, it is difficult to determine
                   how classes and methods contribute to the runtime
                   behavior of features. Moreover, dependencies between
                   system features are not obvious, consequently software
                   maintenance operations often result in unintended side
                   effects. To tackle these problems, we propose a compact
                   feature-driven approach (\ie summarized trace
                   information) based on dynamic analysis to characterize
                   features and computational units of an application. We
                   extract execution traces to achieve an explicit mapping
                   between features and classes using two complementary
                   perspectives. We apply our approach to two case studies
                   and we report our findings.},

  Title          = {Synchronistaion Variables},
  Institution    = {Department of Computer Science, Trinity College},
  Type           = {TCD-CS-94-01},
  abstract       = {It is commonly believed that access to the instance
                   variables of an object by its synchronisation code is
                   needed in order to implement many synchronisation
                   policies. This introduces an obvious difficulty. The
                   synchronisation code must not read an instance variable
                   while that variable is being updated by an operation,
                   otherwise the synchronisation code might see the
                   variable in an inconsistent state. In this paper, we
                   study this problem in depth and solve it by defining a
                   framework to guide the design of synchronisation
                   mechanisms. In solving the problem, our framework
                   illustrates that, contrary to popular belief, access to
                   instance variables by synchronisation mechanisms is
                   {\em not\/} required in order to implement
                   synchronisation policies that apparently rely on the
                   state of the object---such state can be maintained by
                   the synchronisation code itself. Our framework offers
                   additional benefits. Synchronisation mechanisms
                   designed within the guidelines of the framework can
                   possess considerable expressive power. (The example
                   synchronisation mechanism we present subsumes the power
                   of numerous other synchronisation mechanisms.) Also, we
                   show that most of the concepts of our framework can be
                   implemented in terms of existing language constructs,
                   thus minimising complexity that needs to be added to a
                   sequential language in order to support concurrency.},

  abstract       = {Understanding the evolution of an object-oriented
                   systembased on various versions of source code requires
                   analyzing a vast amount of data since an
                   object-oriented system is a complex structure rather
                   than a collection of classes. Our work provides an
                   approach to understand such an evolution by detecting
                   and visualizing phases in the evolution, i.e.,
                   abstractions of time spans where the encapsulated
                   versions all comply with an expression. Our approach is
                   applicable on any level, i.e., not only on system
                   level, but for example also on class level. Our
                   approach furthermore contains a set of measurements on
                   phases that characterize them. Phases help understand
                   an evolution because on the one hand because they
                   enable studying an evolution on a higher level. On the
                   other hand, phases can be detected with multiple
                   expressions at the same time. This results in
                   concurrent phases which enables studying an evolution
                   from different perspectives at the same time.},

                   high-level restructuring is concerned with improving
                   the overall architecture of the system, whereas
                   low-level restructuring deals with repairing local
                   problems which are symptoms of bad style. We propose to
                   characterize these low-level problems as patterns of
                   dependencies between classes as an aid in detecting and
                   resolving them. In this paper we briefly present
                   low-level problems and give two examples of how these

                   reusable and configurable components. We introduce
                   visual composition as a way of constructing
                   applications from plug-compatible software components.
                   After presenting related work, we describe an
                   object-oriented framework for visual composition that
                   supports open system development through the notion of
                   domain-specific composition models. We illustrate the
                   use of the framework through the application of a
                   prototype implementation to a number of very different
                   domains. In each case, a specialized visual composition
                   tool was realized by developing a domain-specific
                   composition model. We conclude with some remarks and
                   observations concerning component engineering and
                   application composition in a context where visual
                   composition is an essential part of the development

                   transaction processing. Most proposals weaken
                   serializability. The concurrency of transactions
                   executing on shared objects can be enhanced with the
                   use of semantic information about operations type or
                   through user defined semantics called transaction
                   semantic. This paper attempts to unify the two
                   approaches; we present an extended model which exploits
                   both transaction and object semantics to increase
                   concurrency. The approach we adopt is similar to the
                   one used in [Lynch83,Molina83,FO89]. However, our
                   mechanism for specifying allowable interleavings is
                   based on predicate over step types and synchronization
                   operators. It supports concurrent execution of steps
                   and synchronization amongst them. We will integrate
                   this distributed concurrency control policy into a high
                   level language to hide low-level details such as locks,
                   timestamps management and concurrent activities
                   synchronization inside the implementation of the
                   language constructs. We use ANSA computational language
                   DPL (Distributed Programming Language) as a basic
                   language construct. We propose a few DPL extensions to
                   support our model. This model is suitable to express a
                   wide range of synchronization constraints between
                   concurrent activities.},

                   that they must cope with open networks, heterogeneous
                   interoperable hardware and software systems, and, above
                   all, evolving and changing requirements. The CHASSIS
                   project aims to develop a software and methodology
                   framework for (i) the security- and
                   reliability-oriented systematic design and construction
                   of heterogeneous information systems from individual
                   existing and newly developed application software
                   components and database systems, and (ii) their secure
                   and reliable interoperation. In CHASSIS,
                   object-orientation is the key technology for the
                   construction of such a system as its uniform interface
                   is realized by an object-oriented data model and the
                   homogenization layer is realized by object-oriented
                   software. CHASSIS includes object models for database
                   and language integration, software to support system
                   integration, specification methods to support the
                   design process and advanced security mechanisms to

                   composition environment? A composition environment must
                   be built of three parts: i) a reusable component
                   library, ii) a component framework determining the
                   software architecture, and iii) an open and flexible
                   composition language. Most of the effort in component
                   technology was spent on the first two parts. Now it is
                   crucial to address the last part and find an
                   appropriate model to glue existing components together.
                   In this work, we investigate existing component and
                   glue models, define a set of requirements a composition
                   language must fulfill, and report our first results
                   using a prototype implementation of a general-purpose
                   composition language based on the Pi-calculus.},

                   stream of new ``silver bullet'' technologies and
                   methods, software productivity remains universally
                   unimpressive. We argue that, as long as industry
                   remains focused on short-term goals, and maintains a
                   technology-centric view of software development, no
                   progress will be made. A clear symptom of this problem
                   is the fact that the metaphors we apply to software
                   development are largely obsolete. Instead of thinking
                   about software as we do about bridges, buildings or
                   hardware components, we should encourage a view of
                   software as a living and evolving entity that is
                   developed and maintained by {\it people}. We begin with
                   some assertions that are intended as food for thought.
                   We continue by reviewing what we consider to be some of
                   the key difficulties with software development today.
                   We conclude with a few recommendations for research
                   into software practices that take evolution into
                   account. },

                   have developed the PiL-calculus, a process calculus in
                   which agents communicate by passing immutable
                   extensible records, called forms, rather than tuples.
                   Using this approach, we are able to model compositional
                   abstractions in a more natural and robust way. In this
                   position paper, we will extend the notion of forms and

                   volume of data, making it difficult to extract high
                   level views. Most techniques developed so far adopt a
                   fine-grained approach to address this issue. In this
                   paper we introduce a novel approach representing entire
                   traces as signals in time. Drawing this analogy between
                   dynamic analysis and signal processing, we are able to
                   access a rich toolkit of well-established and
                   ready-to-use analysis techniques. As an application of
                   this analogy, we show how to fit a visualization of the
                   complete feature space of a system on one page only:
                   our approach visualizes feature traces as time plots,
                   summarizes the trace signals and uses dynamic time
                   warping to group them by similar features. We apply the
                   approach on a case study, and discuss both common and
                   unique patterns as observed on the visualization.},

                   have the source code of an application but you miss its

                   to understand these systems you need reverse
                   engineering tools. UMLDesignExtractor is the prototype
                   of a reverse engineering tool generating UML class
                   diagrams from object-oriented code. UMLDesignExtractor
                   is built on top of MOOSE and is written in SMALLTALK.
                   For the graphical output it uses the API of Rational

  Title          = {Meta-level Language Bridging},
  Note           = {Software Composition Group, University of Bern},
  abstract       = {Scripting and composition languages offer high-level
                   mechanisms to combine and compose services provided by
                   a lower-level host programming language. Inter-language
                   bridging mechanisms are therefore needed to map host
                   language entities and services to abstractions of the
                   scripting language, and vice versa. Many popular
                   languages such as Python, Perl, and Ruby use a bridging
                   approach based on wrappers that must be written or
                   generated in the host language. Other languages like
                   Jython and Kawa adopt a fixed bridging strategy that
                   exploits reflective features provided by the host
                   language. Although both of these approaches are usable,
                   they are cumbersome and low-level. In particular, it
                   can be very difficult to adapt host language services
                   to cooperate seamlessly with abstractions of the
                   scripting language. In this paper we present a
                   lightweight bridging strategy for scripting and
                   composition languages that simplifies the task of
                   adapting host language services to the abstraction
                   level of the scripting language. This strategy uses
                   introspection facilities of the host language to
                   automate the wrapping process, while providing a hook
                   for programmer-defined adaptation of the generated
                   interface. A meta-level bridging layer is responsible
                   for wrapping and unwrapping both host and scripting
                   language entities so they can seamlessly cooperate. The
                   bridging strategy employs partial evaluation of
                   wrapping and unwrapping operations to achieve
                   acceptable performance.},

                   dependable systems which emphasizes {\it modularity}
                   and {\it composition}. Dependability and functionality
                   aspects of an application may be described separately
                   providing a separation of design concerns. Furthermore,
                   the dependability protocols of an application may be
                   constructed bottom-up as simple protocols that are
                   composed into more complex protocols. Composition makes
                   it easier to reason about dependability and supports
                   the construction of general reusable dependability
                   schemes. A significant aspect of our language framework
                   is that dependability protocols may be loaded into a
                   running application and installed dynamically. Dynamic
                   installation makes it possible to impose additional
                   dependability protocols on a server as clients with new
                   dependability demands are integrated into a system.
                   Similarly, if a given dependability protocol is only
                   necessary during some critical phase of execution, it
                   may be installed during that period only.},

                   inheritance relationships and a proliferation of
                   run-time downcasts. Refactoring to eliminate these
                   anomalies may not be an option, at least in certain
                   stages of software evolution. Classboxes are modules
                   that restrict the visibility of changes to selected
                   clients only, thereby offering more freedom in the way
                   unanticipated changes may be implemented, and thus
                   reducing the need for convoluted design anomalies. In
                   this paper we demonstrate how classboxes can be
                   implemented in statically-typed languages like {Java}.
                   We also present an extended case study of Swing, a
                   {Java} GUI package built on top of AWT, and we document
                   the ensuing anomalies that Swing introduces. We show
                   how Classbox/J, a prototype implementation of
                   classboxes for {Java}, is used to provide a cleaner
                   implementation of Swing using local refinement rather
                   than subclassing.},

                   distributed systems is to provide abstractions for
                   coordination. A common type of coordination requires
                   reactivity in response to arbitrary communication
                   patterns. We have developed a communication model in
                   which concurrent objects can be activated by sets of
                   messages. Specifically, our model allows direct and
                   abstract expression of common interaction patterns
                   found in concurrent systems. For example, the model
                   captures multiple clients that collectively invoke
                   shared servers as a single activation. Furthermore, it
                   supports definition of individual clients that
                   concurrently invoke multiple servers and wait for
                   subsets of the returned reply messages. Message sets
                   are dynamically defined using conjunctive and
                   disjunctive combinators that may depend on the patterns
                   of messages. The model subsumes existing models for
                   multi-RPC and multi-party synchronization within a
                   single, uniform activation framework.},

                   which attempts to minimize and localize dependency on
                   the context in which the software will be used. An
                   Adaptive program is written in terms of constraints on
                   the customizing context in which the program may be
                   used. The constraints are written so that the only
                   encode necessary dependencies and at the same time they
                   localize information on groups of collaborating
                   classes. Adaptive software is usually written for a
                   given context in mind and therefore it is important
                   that the adaptive program does not use too much
                   information from the current context. Therefore, we
                   introduce in this paper a dependency metric which
                   measures context dependency between an adaptive program
                   and a customizer. The paper also discusses how
                   constraints on customizing contexts can be written so
                   that information loss is eliminated.},

  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {In component-based software development, a software
                   application is composed of components that are plugged
                   together. While components represent the stable parts,
                   the changing or evolving configuration of a system is
                   defined in scripts. The separation of changing from
                   stable parts promises flexible software systems.
                   Compositional styles that define component interfaces,
                   higher-level connectors and composition rules describe
                   an architectural framework. Styles expose the
                   large-scale architecture of a software system
                   explicitly in scripts. But they lack a formal
                   foundation allowing one to reason about styles. We
                   propose to use Contractual types, an experimental type
                   system that can express both services provided and
                   required by a component, as a formal basis to define
                   compositional styles. We argue that this approach
                   permits us (1) to verify the consistency of a style,
                   (2) to check the implementation of a style for
                   correctness, and (3) to detect compositional mismatches
                   in component configurations. We exemplify our claims by
                   giving type-based definitions of some compositional
                   styles. Implementing a contractual type checker for the
                   composition language Piccola allows us to verify
                   existing style implementations in Piccola against the
                   definitions given. A flexible implementation of the
                   Piccola language in {Java} provides a basis for the
                   experiments with the type system.},

  abstract       = {Developing web applications is difficult since (1) the
                   client-server relationship is asymmetric: the server
                   cannot update clients but only responds to client
                   requests and (2) the navigation facilities of web
                   browsers lead to a situation where servers cannot
                   control the state of the clients. Page-centric web
                   application frameworks fail to offer adequate solutions
                   to model control flow at a high-level of abstraction.
                   Developers have to work manually around the
                   shortcomings of the HTTP protocol. Some approaches
                   offer better abstractions by composing an application
                   out of components, however they still fail to offer
                   modeling control flow at a high level.
                   Continuation-based approaches solve this problem by
                   providing the facilities to model a control flow over
                   several pages with one piece of code. However combining
                   multiple flows inside the same page is difficult. This
                   article presents Seaside. Seaside is a framework which
                   combines an objectoriented approach with a
                   continuation-based one. A Seaside application is built
                   out of components (i.e., objects) and the logic of the
                   application benefits from the continuation-based
                   program flow infrastructure. Seaside offers a unique
                   way to have multiple control flows on a page, one for
                   each component. This enables the developer to write
                   components that are highly reusable and that can be
                   used to compose complex web applications with higher
                   quality in less time.},

                   reuse in object-oriented programming, we must better
                   understand the process involved in software reuse. Our
                   work addresses this need, analyzing four experienced
                   Smalltalk programmers as they enhanced applications by
                   reusing new classes. These were {\itactive}
                   programmers: rather than suspending programming
                   activity to reflect on how to use the new components,
                   they began work immediately recruiting code from
                   example usage contexts and relying heavily on the
                   system debugger to guide them in applying the borrowed
                   context. We discuss the implications of these findings
                   for reuse documentation, programming instruction and
                   tools to support reuse.},

                   cause-effect gap between the time when an error occurs
                   and the time when the error becomes apparent to the
                   programmer. Although debugging techniques such as condi
                   tional and data breakpoints help to find error causes
                   in simple cases, they fail to effectively bridge the
                   cause-effect gap in many situations. Dynamic query-
                   based debuggers offer programmers an effective tool
                   that provides instant error alert by continuously
                   checking inter-object relationships while the debugged
                   program is running. To speed up dynamic query
                   evaluation, our debugger (implemented in portable
                   {Java}) uses a combination of program instrumentation,
                   load-time code generation, query optimization, and
                   incre mental reevaluation. Experiments and a query cost
                   model show that selection queries are efficient in most
                   cases, while more costly join queries are practical
                   when query evaluations are infrequent or query domains

                   significantly different versions of a toy language
                   which supports the above features. The ease with which
                   the different versions of this language are
                   accommodated provides some evidence for the
                   applicability of the framework for a wide range of
                   languages, as well as its usefulness for comparing
                   different language designs and examining the

                   during the execution of some program component. This
                   information is used to assist reasoning about a
                   program, such as determining whether data dependencies
                   may exist between two computations. We define an
                   effects system for {Java} that preserves the
                   abstraction facilities that make object-oriented
                   programming languages attractive. Specifically, a
                   subclass may extend abstract regions of mutable state
                   inherited from the superclass. The effects system also
                   permits an object's state to contain the state of
                   wholly-owned subsidiary objects. In this paper, we
                   describe a set of annotations for declaring permitted
                   effects in method headers, and show how the actual
                   effects in a method body can be checked against the

  abstract       = {A message management system enables its users to
                   automatically process messages. Procedures associated
                   with a workstation may scan incoming mail, perform some
                   routine processing and possibly forward the mail. The
                   global properties of such systems may be far from
                   obvious when large numbers of procedures are present.
                   We attempt to gain insight into global behaviour by
                   studying "message flow". We do so by partitioning
                   message domains into state-spaces, and analyzing the
                   state transitions effected by procedures. Message flow
                   for messages of a given type can thus be represented by
                   a finite automaton whose states are the message states.
                   The finite automata for the various message types can
                   be "welded together" to form a Petri net that
                   accurately captures both the message flow for
                   individual message types and the coordination by
                   procedures of messages of different types. The model is
                   useful for obtaining a descriptive analysis of
                   behaviour, and for analyzing interesting behaviour such
                   as blocking, deadlock, "message loops" and "procedure
                   loops". In addition we present some techniques useful
                   for detecting message loops and procedure loops at run

  abstract       = {Although the term ``software component'' has become
                   commonplace, there is no universally accepted
                   definition of the term, nor does there exist a common
                   foundation for specifying various kinds of components
                   and their compositions. We propose such a foundation.
                   The Piccola Calculus is a process calculus, based on
                   the asynchronous pi-calculus, extended with explicit
                   namespaces. The calculus is high-level, rather than
                   minimal, and is consequently convenient for expressing
                   and reasoning about software components, and different
                   styles of composition. We motivate and present the
                   calculus, and outline how it is used to specify the
                   semantics of Piccola, a small composition language. We
                   demonstrate how the calculus can be used to simplify
                   compositions by partial evaluation, and we briefly
                   outline some other applications of the calculus to
                   reasoning about compositional styles.},

  abstract       = {Object-oriented meta-languages such as MOF or EMOF are
                   often used to specify domain specific languages.
                   However, these meta-languages lack the ability to
                   describe behavior or operational semantics. Several
                   approaches used a subset of Java mixed with OCL as
                   executable meta-languages. In this paper, we report our
                   experience of using Smalltalk as an executable and
                   integrated meta-language. We validated this approach in
                   incrementally building over the last decade, Moose, a
                   meta-described reengineering environment. The
                   reflective capabilities of Smalltalk support a uniform
                   way of letting the base developer focus on his tasks
                   while at the same time allowing him to meta-describe
                   his domain model. The advantage of our this approach is
                   that the developer uses the same tools and environment},

                   its programming environment and tools. First introduced
                   more than 20 years ago, the Smalltalk browser enables
                   programmers to ``home in'' on particular methods using
                   a hierarchy of manually-defined classifications. By its
                   nature, this classification scheme says a lot about the
                   desired state of the code, but little about the actual
                   state of the code as it is being developed. We have
                   extended the Smalltalk browser with dynamically
                   computed virtual categories that dramatically improve
                   the browser's support for incremental programming. We
                   illustrate these improvements by example, and describe
                   the algorithms used to compute the virtual categories
                   efficiently.},

                   computations at a high-level of abstraction, allowing
                   one to manipulate and query whole sets of data at once.
                   This paper presents the OPA model that enhances
                   object-oriented programming with array programming
                   features. The goal of OPA is to determine a minimum set
                   of modifications that must be made to the traditional
                   object model in order to take advantage of the
                   possibilities of array programming. It is based on a
                   minimal extension of method invocation and the
                   definition of a kernel of methods implementing
                   fundamental array programming operations. The OPA model
                   presents a generalization of traditional message
                   passing in the sense that a message can be send to an
                   entire set of objects. The model is validated in FS, a
                   new scripting language.},

                   for software composition has suffered from the inherent
                   problem that reusability and extensibility are hampered
                   by the dependence on position and arity of parameters.
                   In order to address this issue, we have defined
                   lambdaF, a substitution-free variant of the
                   lambdaF-calculus where names are replaced with
                   first-class namespaces and parameter passing is modeled
                   using explicit contexts. We have used lambdaF to define
                   a model for classboxes, a dynamically typed module
                   system for object-oriented languages that provides
                   support for controlling both the visibility and
                   composition of class extensions. This model not only
                   illustrates the expressive power and flexibility of
                   lambdaF as a suitable formal foundation for
                   compositional abstractions, but also assists us in
                   validating and extending the concept of classboxes in a
                   language-neutral way.},

                   key prerequisite to maintaining an object-oriented
                   software system. Unfortunately, classical editing and
                   browsing tools offer mainly linear and textual views of
                   classes and their implementation. These views fail to
                   expose the semantic relationships between the internal
                   parts of a class. We propose XRay views --a technique
                   based on Concept Analysis-- which reveal the internal
                   relationships between groups of methods and attributes
                   of a class. XRay views are composed out of elementary
                   collaborations between attributes and methods, and help
                   the engineer to build a mental model of how a class
                   works internally. In this paper we present XRay views,
                   and illustrate the approach by applying it on the
                   Smalltalk class UIBuilder. },

                   source-code of an object-oriented program without
                   changing its external behaviour --- has been studied
                   intensively within the last decade. This diversity has
                   created a plethora of toy-examples, cases and code
                   snippets, which make it hard to assess the current
                   state-of-the-art. Moreover, due to this diversity,
                   there is currently no accepted way of teaching good
                   refactoring practices, despite the acknowledgment in
                   the software engineering body of knowledge. Therefore,

                   comparing frequency distributed data. The original
                   interpretation of the Bhattacharyya metric as a
                   geometric similarity measure is reviewed and it is
                   pointed out that this derivation is independent of the
                   use of the Bhattacharyya measure as an upper bound on
                   the probability of misclassification in a two-class
                   problem. The affinity between the Bhattacharyya and
                   Matusita measures is described and we suggest use of
                   the Bhattacharyya measure for comparing histogram data.
                   We explain how the chi-squared statistic compensates
                   for the implicit assumption of a Euclidean distance
                   measure being the shortest path between two points in
                   high dimensional space. By using the square-root
                   transformation the Bhattacharyya metric requires no
                   such standardization and by its multiplicative nature
                   has no singularity problems unlike those caused by the
                   denominator of the chi-squared statistic with zero
                   count-data.},

                   such as receipt of mail. Such systems are characterized
                   by a high degree of parallel activity that cooperates
                   with but may run independently of user processes.
                   Traditional high-level programming languages do not
                   readily capture this sort of behaviour. This makes
                   building a customized OIS a painful process. "Objects"
                   are entities with contents and a set of rules
                   describing their use. We believe that objects are a
                   useful primitive for designing and building such

                   reduce complexity. This principle is especially
                   important when it is used to separate stable from
                   flexible parts of software systems to reduce the
                   complexity of software evolution. We encapsulate the
                   stable parts as components and the flexible parts as
                   scripts. But there is a large range of requirements and
                   consequent techniques available to achieve this
                   separation. We propose a simple, unifying framework of
                   forms, agents, and channels for modelling components
                   and scripts. We have also developed an experimental
                   composition language, called Piccola, based on this
                   framework, that supports the specification of
                   applications as flexible compositions of stable

                   intellectual issue of the research in distributed
                   systems. Figuring out how to build and maintain those
                   systems becomes a central issue in distributed systems
                   research today. Although CORBA seems to provide all the
                   necessary support to the construction of those systems,
                   CORBA provides a very limited support to the evolution
                   of their requirements. The main problem is that the
                   description of the elements from which the systems are
                   built, and the way in which they are composed are mixed
                   into the application code, making systems difficult to
                   understand, modify and customize. A possible solution
                   to this problem goes through the introduction of the
                   so-called coordination models and languages into the
                   CORBA model. We propose in this paper a coordination
                   programming system called CORODS which introduces the
                   CoLaSD coordination model and language into the CORBA
                   model. CoLaSD is a coordination model based on the
                   notion of Coordination Groups, entities that specify,
                   control and enforces the coordination of groups of
                   collaborating active objects.},

                   specify the patterns of interaction among software
                   components so that they can be assembled to perform
                   tasks in a cooperative way. Such cooperative assembly
                   requires that components obey rules ensuring their
                   interaction compatibility. The choice of a specific
                   approach to specifying rules depends on various
                   criteria such as the kind of target environment, the
                   nature of the software components or the kind of
                   programming language. This chapter reviews major
                   efforts to develop and promote standards that address
                   this issue. We present our own approach to the
                   construction of a development framework for software
                   applications that make use of real-time financial
                   information. For this domain, the two main requirements
                   are (1) to facilitate the integration of new components
                   into an existing system, and (2) to allow for the
                   run-time composition of software components.The goal of
                   the development framework is to provide dynamic
                   interconnection capabilities. The basic idea is to
                   standardize and reuse interaction protocols that are
                   encapsulated inside special objects called gluons.
                   These objects mediate the cooperation of software
                   components. We discuss the advantages of the approach,
                   and provide examples of how gluons are used in the
                   financial framework.},

                   We define this mechanism in terms of fuzzy relations.
                   We introduce affinity contexts as a way of expressing
                   contexts of relationships on a set of objects and we
                   present operations that allow for their combination. We
                   outline Satellite, a tool for the visualization and

                   navigation by context-dependent proximity. The tool

                   task, and to support it many approaches have been
                   developed. Often, the result of these approaches
                   categorize existing entities into new groups or
                   associates them with mutually exclusive properties. In
                   this paper we present the Distribution Map as a generic
                   technique to visualize and analyze this type of result.
                   Our technique is based on the notion of focus, which
                   shows whether a property is well-encapsulated or
                   cross-cutting, and the notion of spread, which shows
                   whether the property is present in several parts of the
                   system. We present a basic visualization and complement
                   it with measurements that quantify focus and spread. To
                   validate our technique we show evidence of applying it
                   on the result sets of different analysis approaches. As
                   a conclusion we propose that the Distribution Map
                   technique should belong to any reverse engineering

                   objects, instances of other classes called metaclasses.
                   In the same way as classes define the properties of
                   their instances, metaclasses define the properties of
                   classes. It is therefore very natural to wish to reuse
                   class properties, utilizing them amongst several
                   classes. However this introduced metaclass composition
                   problems, i.e., code fragments applied to one class may
                   break when used on another class due to the inheritance
                   relationship between their respective metaclasses.
                   Numerous approaches have tried to solve metaclass
                   composition problems, but they always resort to an
                   ad-hoc manner of handling conflicting properties,
                   alienating the meta-programmer. We propose a uniform
                   approach that represents class properties as traits,
                   groups of methods that act as a unit of reuse from
                   which classes are composed. Like all the other classes
                   in the system, metaclasses are composed out of traits.
                   This solution supports the reuse of class properties,
                   and their safe and automatic composition based on
                   explicit conflict resolution. The paper discusses
                   traits and our solution, shows concrete examples
                   implemented in the Smalltalk environment Squeak, and
                   compares our approach with existing models for
                   composing class properties. },

  School         = {University of Bern},

  abstract       = {Smalltalk traditionally has good support for
                   structural reflection. This comes from the fact that
                   classes are first class, high level objects. This
                   reflection support has allowed Smalltalk
                   implementations to build tools decades ago that surpass
                   those of many other languages today. These tools are
                   basically a user interface for introspection and
                   intercession. The reflective facilities of Smalltalk
                   are not only used by tools but also by Smalltalk
                   developers for metaprogramming. However the Smalltalk
                   reflection support stops at the method border. The only
                   first class models for reflection at the sub-method
                   level Smalltalk supports are collections of bytes or
                   characters. This prevents tools from truly looking into
                   the method and makes it hard to create a new generation
                   of tools that go beyond the five pane browser and work
                   at the sub-method level. It also prevents Smalltalk
                   developers from doing metaprogramming at a sub-method
                   level. We present reflective methods: a first class,
                   high level abstraction of a method that supports rich
                   structural reflection at the sub-method level and show
                   how it eases metaprogramming and the creation of tools
                   at the sub-method level such as a pluggable type
                   checker.},

                   software visualization tool. It has been validated in
                   several industrial case studies over the past years.
                   CodeCrawler enables the fast exploration of new
                   visualization ideas. It implements and visualizes
                   polymetric views, visualizations of software enriched
                   with information such as software metrics and other
                   source code semantics. It provides a rich set of views
                   that can be customized using a large set of metrics.
                   While CodeCrawler is mainly targeted at visualizing
                   object-oriented software, in its latest implementation
                   it has become a general information visualization tool.},

                   and provide useful information for browsers and
                   optimizing compilers. Self features objects with
                   dynamic inheritance. This construct has until now been
                   considered incompatible with type inference because it
                   allows the inheritance graph to change dynamically. Our
                   algorithm handles this by deriving and solving type
                   constraints that simultaneously define supersets of
                   both the possible values of expressions and of the
                   possible inheritance graphs. The apparent circularity
                   is resolved by computing a global fixed-point, in
                   polynomial time. The algorithm has been implemented and
                   can successfully handle the Self benchmark programs,
                   which exist in the "standard Self world" of more than

                   an efficient way to determine the purpose and abilities
                   of a class. Finding those patterns is not trivial
                   because the graphical representation of a large
                   software system is too complex to be grasped by a
                   software reengineer or a group of reengineers to find
                   all the similarities and patterns in it. This thesis
                   presents a technique to discover known and unknown
                   class patterns automatically in a software system. Our
                   approach is based on the theory of graph pattern
                   recognition, mainly graph edit distance and maximal
                   common subgraph (MCS) algorithms. Using MCS and
                   hierarchical clustering we automatically detect known

                   the new requirements. Furthermore, due to design
                   decisions, the new requirements happen to crosscut the
                   system's structure. Understanding how changes appear in
                   the system can reveal hidden dependencies between
                   different parts of the system. We propose to group
                   entities that change together according to a logical
                   expression that specifies the change condition.
                   Furthermore, we can group entities at different levels
                   of abstraction (i.e., method, class, package). Our
                   approach is based on an explicit history meta model
                   that centers around the notion of history and which
                   enables the definition of historical measurements which
                   summarize the changes. We apply our approach on two
                   large case studies and show how we can identify groups
                   of related entities and detect bad smells.},

  abstract       = {Predicate classes are a new linguistic construct
                   designed to complement normal classes in
                   object-oriented languages. Like a normal class, a
                   predicate class has a set of superclasses, methods, and
                   instance variables. However, unlike a normal class, an
                   object is automatically an instance of a predicate
                   class whenever it satisfies a predicate expression
                   associated with the predicate class. The predicate
                   expression can test the value or state of the object,
                   thus supporting a form of implicit property-based
                   classification that augments the explicit type-based
                   classification provided by normal classes. By
                   associating methods with predicate classes, method
                   lookup can depend not only on the dynamic class of an
                   argument but also on its dynamic value or state. If an
                   object is modified, the property-based classification
                   of an object can change over time, implementing shifts
                   in major behavior modes of the object. A version of
                   predicate classes has been designed and implemented in
                   the context of the Cecil language.},

                   database views in traditional database systems, except
                   that our object views hide or expose methods as well as
                   data. The mechanism is based on built-in facilities of
                   our project model for defining data and procedure
                   abstractions and for constructing new types and
                   objects. It uses the type system and the query language
                   of the model to support arbitrary transformations of
                   the underlying representations in designing database
                   views. Careful use of the query language allows one to
                   define updatable views. We also indicate how our
                   abstraction and view mapping capabilities can be used
                   to support federation of heterogeneous software and

  Title          = {Modeling History to Understand Software Evolution},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  Address        = {Berne},
  abstract       = {Over the past three decades, more and more research
                   has been spent on understanding software evolution. The
                   development and spread of versioning systems made
                   valuable data available for study. Indeed, versioning
                   systems provide rich information for analyzing software
                   evolution, but it is exactly the richness of the
                   information that raises the problem. The more versions
                   we consider, the more data we have at hand. The more
                   data we have at hand, the more techniques we need to
                   employ to analyze it. The more techniques we need, the
                   more generic the infrastructure should be. The
                   approaches developed so far rely on ad-hoc models, or
                   on too specific meta-models, and thus, it is difficult
                   to reuse or compare their results. We argue for the
                   need of an explicit and generic meta-model for allowing
                   the expression and combination of software evolution
                   analyses. We review the state-of-the-art in software
                   evolution analysis and we conclude that: \emph{To
                   provide a generic meta-model for expressing software
                   evolution analyses, we need to recognize the evolution
                   as an explicit phenomenon and model it as a first class
                   entity.} Our solution is to encapsulate the evolution
                   in the explicit notion of history as a sequence of
                   versions, and to build a meta-model around these
                   notions: Hismo. To show the usefulness of our
                   meta-model we exercise its dif ferent characteristics
                   by building several reverse engineering applications.
                   This dissertation of fers a meta-model for software
                   evolution analysis yet, the concepts of history and
                   version do not necessarily depend on software. We show
                   how the concept of history can be generalized and how
                   we can obtain our meta-model by transformations applied
                   on structural meta-models. As a consequence, our
                   approach of modeling evolution is not restricted to
                   software analysis, but can be applied to other fields
                   as well.},

                   programming areas, like applications programming or

                   languages, based on the principle of curried functions,

                   compositions and closures are given. A particular
                   section shows how closures of C++/Objective-C objects

                   access distributed replicated services without regard
                   for the number of objects that provide the service.
                   Gaggles are not themselves a replication mechanism;
                   instead they enable programmers to construct their own
                   replicated distributed services in whatever way is
                   appropriate for the application at hand, and then to
                   encapsulate the result. From the point of view of a
                   client, a Gaggle can be named and invoked exactly like
                   an object. However, Gaggles can be used to represent
                   individual objects, several ordinary objects, or even
                   several other Gaggles. In this way they encapsulate
                   plurality. If a Gaggle is used as an invokee, one of
                   the objects that it represents is chosen
                   (non-deterministically) to receive the invocation.},

                   "visitor," "strategy," and similar design patterns, and
                   a form of "open objects." However, previous work on
                   statically typed multimethods whose arguments are
                   treated symmetrically has required the whole program to
                   be available in order to perform typechecking. We
                   describe Dubious, a simple core language including
                   first-class generic functions with symmetric
                   multimethods, a classless object model, and modules
                   that can be separately typechecked. We identify two
                   sets of restrictions that ensure modular type safety
                   for Dubious as well as an interesting intermediate

                   and message passing are designed to have a natural
                   semantics and to be efficient. Conventional and
                   controversial concepts such as class, inheritance, and
                   method combination, on the other hand, are classified
                   as policy, and are left open to the user by providing
                   so-called hook mechanisms. TAO is a language conforming
                   to this framework and has only a few more than twenty
                   primitives for object-oriented programming. This paper

                   maintenance of software systems. Legacy systems are not
                   only limited to procedural languages, but are also
                   written in object-oriented languages. In such a
                   context, understanding classes is a key activity as
                   they are the cornerstone of the object-oriented
                   paradigm and the primary abstraction from which
                   applications are built. Such an understanding is
                   however difficult to obtain because of reasons such as
                   the presence of late binding and inheritance. A first
                   level of class understanding consists of the
                   understanding of its overall structure, the control
                   flow among its methods, and the accesses on its
                   attributes. We propose a novel visualization of classes
                   called class blueprint that is based on a semantically
                   enriched visualization of the internal structure of
                   classes. This visualization allows a software engineer
                   to build a first mental model of a class that he
                   validates via opportunistic code-reading. Furthermore,
                   we have identified visual patterns that represent
                   recurrent situations and as such convey additional
                   information to the viewer. The contributions of this
                   article are the class blueprint, a novel visualization
                   of the internal structure of classes, the
                   identification of visual patterns, and the definition
                   of a vocabulary based on these visual patterns. We have
                   performed several case studies of which one is
                   presented in depth, and validated the usefulness of the
                   approach in a controlled experiment.},

                   and configuring reusable components. A key problem is
                   the synchronization of components: components must be
                   designed to work in different configurations with,
                   possibly, different synchronization requirements. In
                   this paper we discuss support for synchronization in
                   virtual world infrastructures constructed by
                   configuring reusable components.},

                   key prerequisite to maintaining an object-oriented
                   software system. Unfortunately, classical editing and
                   browsing tools offer mainly linear and textual views of
                   classes and their implementation. These views fail to
                   expose the semantic relationships between the internal
                   parts of a class. We propose XRay views --a technique
                   based on Concept Analysis-- which reveal the internal
                   relationships between groups of methods and attributes
                   of a class. XRay views are composed out of elementary
                   collaborations between attributes and methods and help
                   the engineer to build a mental model of how a class
                   works internally. In this paper we present XRay views,
                   and illustrate the approach by applying it to three
                   Smalltalk classes: OrderedCollection, Scanner, and
                   UIBuilder. },

  abstract       = {Statically and dynamically typed programming languages
                   have complementary strengths. While static typing
                   provides early error detection, optimized execution and
                   machine-checkable documentation, dynamic typing makes a
                   language more expressive, better suited for rapid
                   prototyping and more adaptive to changing requirements.
                   Pluggable type systems strive to combine these
                   strengths by declaring types and type systems to be
                   optional. Supporting multiple coexisting type systems,
                   pluggable type systems open up a language to various
                   kinds of static analyses other than those provided by
                   traditional type systems. We present TypePlug, a
                   framework for pluggable type systems for Smalltalk.
                   TypePlug provides infrastructure to optionally annotate
                   source code with types and to define in a simple way
                   semantics for type systems. It contains a generic type
                   checking algorithm, dealing with issues arising when
                   statically checking a a dynamically typed language. To
                   improve type checking results and the user experience,
                   TypePlug integrates optional type inference. We
                   introduce type systems comparable to traditional
                   class-based type systems and a type system for
                   confinement, proving the validity of our approach.},

                   Raising the level of abstraction is a time-honored way
                   of dealing with complexity, but the real benefit of
                   composable software systems lies in their increased
                   {\it flexibility}: a system built from components
                   should be easy to recompose to address new
                   requirements. A certain amount of success has been
                   achieved in some well-understood application domains,

                   toolkits, fourth generation languages and application
                   generators. But how can we generalize this?},

                   of pervasive, wireless, spontaneously networked
                   computing devices. Whatever these devices do, they will
                   have to talk to and negotiate with one another, and so
                   software agents will have to represent them. Whereas
                   conventional services on intranets will continue to be
                   distributed using established middleware standards,
                   internet services are being built on top of http, wap
                   or other protocols, and exchange information in HTML,
                   XML and just about anything that can be wrapped as a
                   MIME type or streamed. This situation leads us to three
                   software problems: (i) How can we simplify the task of
                   programming these agents? (i.e., {Java} is not enough),
                   (ii) How can agents interact and interoperate in an
                   open, evolving network environment? (i.e., XML is not
                   enough), (iii) How can we reason about the services
                   that agents provide and use? (i.e., IDL is not enough).
                   We discuss these questions in the context of our work
                   on Piccola, a small composition language, and outline

                   great use for the understanding of a software system
                   when only its source code is available. However,
                   understanding a large software system by visualizing
                   only its lower level artifacts (e.g., classes, methods)
                   and the relations between them does not scale for
                   industrial-size systems. To address the scalability
                   issue, higher level hierarchical abstractions (e.g.,
                   package structure, clustered decompositions of the
                   system) should be used together with relations between
                   them that are usually aggregated from the lower level
                   relations. In this paper, we present the concepts
                   behind Softwarenaut, a tool aimed at exploring any kind
                   of hierarchical decompositions of a system, and then we
                   look at a specific exploration of a system. In the
                   experiment, the hierarchical decomposition of the
                   system is the result of applying a semantical
                   clustering to group classes that use similar terms.},

                   Object-oriented concepts have been utilized in
                   developing its high-level architecture and its
                   low-level implementation. The Clockworks is defined as
                   a collection of objects which communicate with the user
                   and each other via messages. The actual implementation
                   involved the creation of an object-oriented programming

                   a rich research environment for exploring modeling,

  abstract       = {Under many circumstances, the development of
                   distributed applications greatly benefits from
                   mechanisms like process groups, reliable ordered
                   multicast, and message passing. However, toolkits
                   offering these capabilities are often low-level and
                   therefore difficult to program. To ease the development
                   of distributed applications, in this paper we propose
                   to hide these low-level functions behind
                   object-oriented abstractions such as object-groups,
                   Remote Method Calling , and Smart Proxies. Furthermore,
                   we describe how the Electra toolkit provides such
                   object-oriented abstractions in a portable and highly
                   machine-independent way.},

                   programming languages supporting high order
                   abstractions are needed. These high order abstractions
                   are called components. Since most of the currently
                   available programming languages and systems fail to
                   provide sufficient support for specifying and
                   implementing components, we are developing a new
                   language suitable for software composition. It is not
                   clear how such a language will look like, what kind of
                   abstractions it must support, and what kind of formal
                   model it will be based on. Object-oriented programming
                   languages address some of the needs of present-day
                   applications, and it is therefore obvious to integrate
                   some of their concepts and abstractions in the
                   language. As a first step towards such an integration,
                   we have to define an object model. Since no generally
                   accepted formal object model exists, we have chosen the
                   Pi-calculus as a basis for modelling. In order to find
                   a suitable object model, we have built up an object
                   modelling workbench for Pict, an implementation of an
                   asynchronous Pi-calculus. In this work, we define a
                   first abstract object model, describe several
                   implementations of the object model in Pict, and
                   discuss interesting features and possible extensions.},

                   development environments (SDEs) using a computational
                   model OOAG (Object Oriented Attribute Grammar), which
                   incorporates functions for managing changes and
                   maintaining consistency. In SDEs, the change management
                   and consistency maintenance are key issues and OOAG is
                   suitable for describing them. Software objects in SDEs
                   have many derived values, and software objects and
                   their derived values have complex relations with each
                   other. Careless human activities often cause
                   inconsistencies among software objects and it usually
                   costs a lot to recover them. OOAG provides declarative
                   descriptions to re-compute automatically derived values
                   based on change propagation and to check relations
                   among software objects, which help recovering
                   activities of programmers. OOAG treats SDEs as
                   aggregated active objects, i.e. tree structures, where
                   software products are distributed. Managing changes of
                   derived values and consistency among software objects
                   are described over tree structures in declarative
                   manner. Attributes associated with nodes are
                   re-computed automatically, if necessary. OOAG is a
                   computational model with the following extensions to
                   standard attribute grammars (AGs): (1) OOAG can change
                   tree structures depending upon their attribute values.
                   (AGs hat have this function are called higher order
                   attribute grammars). (2) OOAG can describe message
                   passing which pastes temporary attributes and their
                   attribution rules to the tree structure. The aim of
                   this paper is to show that our approach of treating
                   SDEs as aggregated objects is natural and OOAG's
                   features are suited for the task of describing change
                   management and consistency control in
                   structure-oriented software development environments.},

                   the semantics or runtime of applications. However, lot
                   of approaches to support reflection are based on
                   up-front fully reflective or load-time based reflection
                   mechanisms. Using these approaches, it is not possible
                   to apply reflective techniques on running systems
                   without stopping them, unless the system is fully
                   reflection which is very costly. Because many
                   applications and systems exist that cannot be halted
                   and stopped but have to be always on and running, such
                   as web applications, real-time systems or mobile
                   systems, the ability to apply reflective features at
                   runtime is a crucial and important property. Our
                   solution to achieve this possibility is unanticipated
                   reflection. With unanticipated reflection, we can
                   design the MOP required for the problem we want to
                   solve, introduce it in the language, activate the
                   reflective mechanisms and possibly remove them once
                   they are not necessary anymore at runtime, without
                   halting the system or the application in which we want
                   to apply and use the reflective mechanisms. },

  abstract       = {Moose is a language independent tool environment to
                   reverse engineer and reengineer object-oriented
                   systems. It consists of a repository to store models of
                   software systems, provides query and navigation
                   facilities, metrics and other analysis support. Models
                   consist of entities representing software artifacts
                   such as classes and methods. This document describes a
                   metrics front-end for Moose, whose goal is to visualize
                   the relationship among different metrics of the same
                   model and export this information to an external file.
                   With this tool the user can analyse software metrics
                   and observe the relationships among them. Collecting
                   these informations leads to a better understanding of
                   the software which has to be analysed or reengineered.
                   The ability to export metric values into an external
                   statistic tool such as MS Excel enables the user to
                   create diagrams and apply statistical analysis methods.},

  abstract       = {Analyzing historical information can show how a
                   software system evolved into its current state, but it
                   can also show which parts of the system are more
                   evolution prone. Yet, historical analysis implies
                   processing a vast amount of information which makes the
                   interpretation difficult. To address this issue, we
                   introduce the notion of history of source code
                   artifacts as a first class entity and define
                   measurements which summarize the evolution of such
                   entities. We then use these measurements to define
                   polymetric views for visualizing the effect of time on
                   class hierarchies. We show the application of our
                   approach on one large open source case study and reveal
                   how we can classify the class hierarchies based on
                   their history.},

  abstract       = {Mixin-based inheritance is an inheritance technique
                   that has been shown to subsume a variety of different
                   inheritance mechanisms. It is based directly upon an
                   incremental modification model of inheritance. This
                   paper addresses the question of how mixins can be seen
                   as named attributes of classes the same way that
                   objects, methods, and also classes in their own right,
                   are seen as named attributes of classes. The general
                   idea is to let a class itself have control over how it
                   is extended. This results in a powerful abstraction
                   mechanism to control the construction of inheritance
                   hierarchies in two ways. Firstly, by being able to
                   constrain the inheritance hierarchy; secondly, by being
                   able to extend a class in a way that is specific for
                   that class. Nested mixins are a direct consequence of
                   having mixins as attributes. The scope rules for nested
                   mixins are discussed, and shown to preserve the
                   encapsulation of objects.},

  Title          = {Bootstrapping {Traits}},
  School         = {University of Bern},
  abstract       = {This thesis discusses the implementation of traits.
                   The result it presents is a new Smalltalk kernel
                   bootstrapped with traits. The implementation is fully
                   done in Squeak, an open-source dialect of Smalltalk. It
                   is planned that the next generation of Squeak will
                   include traits. Because traits are simple and
                   completely backward compatible with single inheritance,
                   implementing traits in a reflective single inheritance
                   language like Squeak is unproblematic. However, an
                   implementation with a sophisticated and clean design,
                   with the robustness to be used in production and the
                   flexibility to be used as a vehicle for future
                   research, is not trivial. Furthermore our work is aimed
                   at serving as a reference implementation for the
                   introduction of traits in other languages. Hence, we
                   focused on building a simple but powerful system for
                   the future. Consequently following the fundamental idea
                   of a reflective language --- using the features of the
                   language to define the behavior of the language itself
                   --- we bootstrapped the new kernel which, eventually,
                   allowed us to fully express the system itself with
                   traits. The refactoring of the core of the Smalltalk
                   language as a composition of traits not only improved
                   its quality but also enhanced its understandability.
                   This has the advantage that it is easier maintainable
                   and it facilitates experimentation with the language
                   because the different aspects of the kernel are now
                   available as traits and can therefore be recomposed to
                   create new kernel classes with different properties.},

                   given, and a semantics is given for a value-passing

                   virtual databases and manipulating their schemas and
                   instances is described. The application of the virtual
                   database concept to supporting both views and versions

                   environments, packages and even keyword based
                   parameters. Typically only a few of these notions are
                   first-class, leading to arbitrary restrictions and
                   limited abstraction power in the host language. Piccola
                   is a small language that unifies various notions of
                   namespaces as first-class forms, or extensible,
                   immutable records. By making namespaces explicit,
                   Piccola is easily able to express various abstractions

                   component-oriented software development. Within this
                   view, one can see applications not only as collections

                   object-oriented systems prescribed by the XUnit
                   framework to a car factory, the result would be an
                   inefficient process: A tire would be created, quality
                   assured and then thrown away, only to be recreated
                   later to test the functionality of the whole car. XUnit
                   makes it difficult to reuse intermediate results of low
                   level unit tests. As a consequence a higher level unit
                   test is forced to recreate test scenarios which were
                   already created by lower level unit tests. This
                   duplicated testing effort is time-consuming both for
                   setting up new scenarios and for running the tests. To
                   address this problem we suggest a semi-automatic

  abstract       = {Over the last thirty years designers have tried to
                   cope with software complexity by organizing system
                   entities into modules, i.e. groups of entities.
                   However, the creation and organization of modules is
                   not straightforward. The criterion with which these
                   modules are built impacts in the maintainability and
                   development of the system. Designers have different
                   interests and personal views of the same system, views
                   that are difficult to communicate and to extract from
                   the code. Poor understanding of this organization
                   increases the complexity of the system e.g. by favoring
                   the addition of duplication and of unexpected rippling
                   effects. This, in turn, lowers the flexibility of the
                   system to changing requirements and leads to a sharp
                   increase in their maintenance cost. To overcome these
                   problems, we present a methodology to manage the
                   locality in object-oriented systems. We develop a model
                   that exploits the contextual information, i.e. the way
                   objects are used by their clients, to understand and
                   improve the organization of classes in the system. With
                   our model we take full advantage of the contextual
                   information of modules to evaluate their cohesion, find
                   misplaced classes, detect hot spots and find the
                   different views that its clients have. In our
                   experimental validation we apply the contextual
                   information to understand, maintain and describe
                   systems. Our methodology is applied successively
                   together with metrics, visualization techniques, and an
                   optimization method named simulated annealing to
                   reverse-engineer object-oriented systems. All in all,
                   we provide a methodology to understand and improve the
                   modularization of object-oriented systems, in an effort
                   towards simplicity.},

  abstract       = {Coordination technology addresses the construction of
                   open, flexible systems from software agents in
                   distributed systems. Most of the work on coordination
                   technology so far has focussed on the development of
                   special coordination languages and environments that
                   provide the basic mechanisms for realizing the
                   coordination layer of a distributed application.
                   Typically each new language proposes its own set of
                   coordination abstractions that realizes a particular
                   paradigm for realizing coordination. Coordination
                   problems, however, are not always well-suited to a
                   particular paradigm. Instead of proposing a new
                   language, we are attempting to develop an open set of
                   software components that realize various useful
                   coordination abstractions. We are validating our
                   approach by developing an experimental framework of
                   coordination components in {Java} and applying them to
                   a canonical set of sample applications. We present our
                   initial analysis of the coordination domain, and give a
                   few examples of simple applications using the developed
                   coordination components.},

                   reverse- and re-engineering complex software systems.
                   Moose provides a set of services including a common
                   meta-model, metrics evaluation and visualization, a
                   model repository, and generic GUI support for querying,
                   browsing and grouping. The development effort invested
                   in Moose has paid off in precisely those research
                   activities that benefit from applying a combination of
                   complementary techniques. We describe how Moose has
                   evolved over the years, we draw a number of lessons
                   learned from our experience, and we outline the present
                   and future of Moose. },

                   components, which, in general, undergo phased and
                   incremental development. In order to facilitate the
                   corresponding construction process, it is important
                   that the development team in charge has a good
                   understanding of how individual software components
                   typically evolve. Furthermore, software engineers need
                   to be able to recognize abnormal patterns of growth
                   with respect to size, structure, and complexity of the
                   components and the resulting composite. Only if a
                   development team understands the processes that
                   underpin the evolution of software systems, will they
                   be able to make better development choices. In this
                   paper, we analyze recurring structural and evolutionary
                   patterns that we have observed in public-domain
                   software systems built using object-oriented
                   programming languages. Based on our analysis, we
                   discuss common growth patterns found in present-day
                   component-based software systems and illustrate simple
                   means to aid developers in achieving a better
                   understanding of those patterns. As a consequence, we
                   hope to raise the awareness level in the community on
                   how component-based software systems tend to naturally

                   best-practice patterns, idioms, coding conventions,

                   mechanisms and the interoperation of the different
                   applications. In this thesis we introduce the Cell, a
                   framework for the design of a scalable Strongly
                   Distributed Object Based System that supports a high
                   level of interoperation between the different
                   applications. The basic element in the Cell framework
                   is a cell which is composed of membrane and a nucleus.
                   The membrane encapsulates the nucleus and provides
                   support for all communication with the external world
                   while the nucleus manages all local resources. A high
                   level interoperation between the applications of the
                   different cells is achieved with the support by the
                   membrane of Object Oriented Interoperability. A
                   prototype implementation of a cell demonstrates the
                   ideas and concepts of the Cell framework and Object

                   static perspective, however, overlooks valuable
                   semantic knowledge of a system's problem domain. To
                   address this problem, several researchers have
                   identified thee potential of exploiting features in a
                   reverse engineering context. Features are
                   well-understood abstractions of a problem domain. As
                   such, they represent a valuable resource for reverse
                   engineering a system, as they encapsulate knowledge of
                   a problem domain and denote units of system behavior.
                   The main body of feature-related reverse engineering
                   research is concerned with feature identification, a
                   technique to map features to source code. To fully
                   exploit features in reverse engineering, however, we
                   need to extend the focus beyond feature identification
                   and exploit features as primary units of analysis. We
                   formulate our thesis as follows: To exploit the domain
                   knowledge for object-oriented system comprehension, we
                   need to model features, their relationships to source
                   artefacts, and their relationships to each other. The
                   main contribution of our work is twofold: on the one
                   hand, we enrich reverse engineering analysis of
                   object-oriented systems with semantic knowledge of
                   features, and on the other hand, we introduce new
                   techniques that treat features as the primary entities
                   of analysis A further contribution is our definition of
                   Dynamix, a model for expressing feature entities in the
                   context of a structural model of source code. Using
                   case studies, we demonstrate how our analysis
                   techniques exploit feature knowledge to establish
                   traceability between the problem and solution domains
                   throughout the life-cycle of a system.},

                   after mixins but avoiding their problems. In this paper
                   we refactor the Smalltalk collections hierarchy using
                   traits. We observed that the original hierarchy
                   contained much duplication of code; traits let us
                   remove all of it. Traits also make possible much more
                   general reuse of collection code outside of the
                   existing hierarchy; for example, they make it easy to
                   convert other collection-like things into true
                   collections. Our refactoring reduced the size of the
                   collection hierarchy by approximately 12 per cent, with
                   no measurable impact on execution efficiency. More
                   importantly, understandability and reusability of the
                   code was significantly improved, and the path was paved
                   for a more intensive refactoring.},

                   maintainers need accurate and automatic identification
                   of the design problems. Current approaches for
                   automatic detection of design problems are not accurate
                   enough because they analyze only a single version of a
                   system and consequently they miss essential information
                   as design problems appear and evolve over time. Our
                   approach is to use the historical information of the
                   suspected flawed structure to increase the accuracy of
                   the automatic problem detection. Our means is to define
                   measurements which summarize how persistent the problem
                   was and how much maintenance effort was spent on the
                   suspected structure. We apply our approach on a large
                   scale case study and show how it improves the accuracy
                   of the detection of God Classes and Data Classes, and

  abstract       = {Creating ones own games has been the main motiva- tion
                   for many people to learn programming. But the barrier
                   to learn a general purpose programming language is very
                   high, especially if some positive results can only be
                   expected after having manually written more than 100
                   lines of code. With this paper we first motivate
                   potential users by showing that one can create classic
                   board- and arcade games like Lights Out, TicTacToe, or
                   Pacman within the playful and constructivist visual
                   learning environment EToys dragging together only a few
                   lines of code. Then we present recurring idioms which
                   helped to develop these games with only a few lines of
                   code.},

  abstract       = {In this technical report we show how to produce a
                   parser for the Ada 83 programming language. It features
                   general ideas about parsing and the parser definitions
                   for main parts of Ada 83. Using SmaCC (Smalltalk
                   Compiler Compiler), a LR-parser-generator, we produce
                   different parsers which are able to parse different
                   parts or also the full language. Our SmaCC-version runs
                   in VisualWorks Smalltalk and we show how our parsers
                   are compiled there, how one can use Smalltalk
                   programming to produce a syntax tree out of the source
                   code and also fetch and process the structure of these
                   codes. The structure and corresponding contents is
                   imported as models into Moose - a tool to measure,
                   analyze, visualize and reengineer legacy applications
                   written in different programming languages in a
                   abstracted way using their concrete model. And there is
                   a discussion about problems one encounters when trying
                   to find exact machine-directives to parse texts in
                   general, how one may fix them and what specific

                   Comprehension focus on program program structure or
                   external documentation. However, by analyzing formal
                   information the informal semantics contained in the
                   vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To understand
                   software as a whole, we need to enrich software
                   analysis with the developer knowledge hidden in the
                   code naming. This paper proposes the use of information
                   retrieval to exploit linguistic information found in
                   source code, such as identifier names and comments. We
                   introduce Semantic Clustering, a technique based on
                   Latent Semantic Indexing and clustering to group source
                   artifacts that use similar vocabulary. We call these
                   groups semantic clusters and we interpret them as
                   linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the
                   code. We compare the topics to each other, identify
                   links between them, provide automatically retrieved
                   labels, and use a visualization to illustrate how they
                   are distributed over the system. Our approach is
                   language independent as it works at the level of
                   identifier names. To validate our approach we applied
                   it on several case studies, two of which we present in
                   this paper.},

                   stream of new technologies and methods, software
                   productivity remains universally unimpressive. We argue
                   that, as long as industry remains focused on short-term
                   goals, and maintains a technology-centric view of
                   software development, no progress will be made. A clear
                   symptom of this problem is the fact that the metaphors
                   we apply to software development are largely obsolete.
                   Instead of thinking about software as we do about
                   bridges, buildings or hardware components, we should
                   encourage a view of software as a living and evolving
                   entity that is developed and maintained by {\it
                   people}. We begin with some assertions that are
                   intended as food for thought. We continue by reviewing
                   what we consider to be some of the key difficulties
                   with software development today. We conclude with a few
                   recommendations for research into software practices
                   that take evolution into account. },

                   tools supporting various methods are stand-alone and

                   the issues of tool integration in software engineering
                   environments. Our main aim in this paper is to
                   illustrate the integration of the analysis tool named
                   Analyst WorkBench(AWB) supporting the O*
                   object-oriented method in the PCTE Emeraude-based
                   software engineering environment. The integration is
                   achieved through data sharing and the reuse of types.
                   The O* method and the AWB have been developed within
                   the framework of the ESPRIT II project named Business

  Title          = {Scripting Interactive Visualizations},
  School         = {University of Bern},
  abstract       = {Data visualization is an important tool in reverse
                   engineering. With a good visualization the interesting
                   parts of the underlying data can be detected faster
                   than by merely inspecting the raw data. One peculiarity
                   of the existing visualization tools is the fact that
                   they implement a finite set of specific visualizations.
                   These specialized tools are not flexible enough to
                   support the user when a slightly or sometimes even
                   drastically different visualization is needed. Often
                   the user needs to be familiar with several
                   visualization tools with each tool expecting a
                   different input format. Usually a large amount of time
                   is being invested into converting the data into the
                   format that is expected by the visualization tool. We
                   propose a new visualization model that is designed to
                   minimize the time-to-solution. We achieve this by
                   working directly on the underlying data, by making
                   nesting an integral part of the model and by defining a
                   powerful scripting language that can be used to define
                   visualizations. We support exploring data in an
                   interactive way by providing hooks for various events.
                   Users can register actions for these events in the
                   visualization script. As a validation of our model we
                   implemented the framework Mondrian and used it to
                   implement several established visualizations. },

  abstract       = {The use of hierarchy is an important component of
                   object-oriented design. Hierarchy allows the use of
                   type families, in which higher level supertypes capture
                   the behavior that all of their subtypes have in common.
                   For this methodology to be effective, it is necessary
                   to have a clear understanding of how subtypes and
                   supertypes are related. This paper presents a new
                   definition of the subtype relation that ensures that
                   any property proved about supertype objects also holds
                   for subtype objects. It also discusses the
                   ramifications of the definition on the design of type
                   families. (superseded by Lisk93c)},

                   complex task exacerbated by the presence of late
                   binding and polymorphism. Moreover, the metaphor of
                   message sending and the anthropomorphism promoted by
                   object-oriented languages makes it difficult to
                   statically identify the precise role the objects play
                   at run-time. We propose a lightweight visualization
                   approach enriched with run-time information which
                   allows us to identify precise aspects of the objects
                   lifetime such as the role played in the creation of
                   other objects and the communication architecture they
                   support. Our approach not only supports the run-time
                   understanding of an application but also allows one to

                   Multiple-inheritance and mixins alleviate this problem,

                   evolution. Changes to classes or mixins can break code

                   both problems by factoring out shared behaviour as sets

                   can be as stringent as the review process for journal
                   publications in other domains. The programme committee
                   for such a conference will typically convene at a
                   meeting, where submitted papers are discussed, and
                   accepted or rejected for presentation at the

                   focussed, and the entire process runs more smoothly if
                   most of the time is devoted to those papers that are

                   integrated with the VisualWorks Smalltalk environment.
                   Because ADvance implicitly uses Smalltalk as its model,
                   it cannot be used for anything but Smalltalk code that
                   is loaded in the image. This project removes this
                   restriction by transparently introducing an explicit
                   model for ADvance using Smalltalk's meta-programming
                   facilities. This solution is validated by showing how
                   it can be used to display ADvance diagrams on Moose

                   intellectual issue of the end of this century. Figuring
                   out how to build those systems will become a central
                   issue in distributed system research in the next
                   future. Although CORBA seems to provide all the
                   necessary support to construct those systems. It
                   provides a very limited support to the evolution of
                   requirements in those systems. The main problem is that
                   the description of the elements from which systems are
                   built, and the way in which they are composed are mixed
                   into the application code. Making them difficult to
                   understand, modify and customize. We think that a
                   solution to this problem goes through the introduction
                   of the so called coordination models and languages into
                   the CORBA model. We propose in this paper the
                   introduction of our object coordination model called
                   CoLaS into the CORBA model.},

                   changes made by one person break the code of an other.
                   These bugs are difficult to find because the problem
                   doesn't belong to one persons area, it's in the
                   interaction of the two components. These kind of bugs
                   can stay undetected for weeks or months and the later
                   they are detected the more difficult it becomes to fix
                   them. With Continuous Integration these kind of bugs
                   can often be detected on the same day that they
                   manifest. This makes fixing the bug a lot easier since
                   the developers know where to look for the bug and they
                   still know why they introduced the changes that lead to
                   the bug. The target of Merlin is to provide a slim
                   Continuous Integration tool for Smal ltalk. Merlin was
                   designed to be extendable with custom plugins. The
                   author is of the opinion that a Continous Integration
                   tool only offers a real surplus if all repetitive and
                   mostly cumbersome tasks of the development process can
                   be handled by the tool. },

  Title          = {Detecting the Methods under Test in {Java}},
  Institution    = {University of Bern},
  Type           = {Informatikprojekt},
  abstract       = {Unit tests are a well accepted part of software
                   engineering. JUnit is the de facto standard for unit
                   testing in Java. It collects, organizes and runs tests.
                   Each test focuses on one or several methods. These are
                   called the methods under test. They can be used for a
                   variety of tasks including test navigation, test
                   coverage and test analysis in general. There are no
                   rules for determining on which methods a test focuses.
                   Sometimes it is obvious, but there are cases where we
                   cannot say on which methods a test focuses. Among
                   others we observed two test patterns that look similar
                   but are the inverse of each other. The first consists
                   of an initial setup method and then focuses on one or
                   several methods. The second one invokes the focused
                   method first and then uses accessors to test the side
                   effects. As a result there are no established and
                   foolproof ways to detect the methods under test
                   automatically. In the following we discuss several
                   different, automated ways of detecting the methods
                   under test. Because there are no rules to determine the
                   methods under test, automatically detecting them can
                   never be fully accurate. But we search for different
                   approaches and try to find out how effective they are.
                   First we present several different ways to annotate a
                   test with its methods under test and choose one of them
                   to annotate the tests of some case studies. We also
                   build a tool that allows us to query these methods and
                   their annotations. Afterward we describe ways to
                   automatically detect the methods under test. The first
                   one called NameAnalyzer looks at the names of tests and
                   test cases and uses naming conventions to determine the
                   methods under test. We also parse the source code of a
                   test and try to extract all methods the test directly
                   invokes. Because this results in a lot of false
                   positives we build a heuristic extension to reduce this
                   noise. We run each of these approaches for analysis on
                   some case studies and validate their output against the
                   annotations described in the first section. Finally we
                   discuss these results, judge the approaches by how
                   effective they are in detecting the methods under test,
                   and conclude.},

                   feature analysis of software systems. Approaches to
                   feature location have used a wide range of techniques
                   such as dynamic analysis, static analysis, information
                   retrieval and formal concept analysis. In this paper we
                   introduce a novel approach to analyze the execution
                   traces of features using Latent Semantic Indexing
                   (LSI). Our goal is twofold. On the one hand we detect
                   similarities between features based on the content of
                   their traces, and on the other hand we categorize
                   classes based on the frequency of the outgoing
                   invocations involved in the traces. We apply our
                   approach on two case studies and we discuss its
                   benefits and drawbacks.},

  abstract       = {ObjChart is a new visual formalism to specify objects
                   and their reactive behavior. A system is specified as a
                   collection of asynchronously communicating objects
                   arranged in a part-of hierarchy, where the reactive
                   behavior of each object is described by a finite state
                   machine. Value propagation is effected using functional
                   invariants over attributes of objects. A compositional
                   semantics for concurrent object behavior is sketched
                   using the equational framework of Misra. In contrast to
                   other Object Oriented modeling notations, ObjChart uses
                   object decomposition as the single refinement paradigm,
                   maintains orthogonality between control flow and value
                   propagation, introduces Sequence object which embodies
                   structural induction, and allows tracing causality
                   chains in time linear in the size of the system.
                   ObjChart's minimality of notations and precise
                   semantics make ObjChart models of systems coherent and
                   executable.},

                   ideas, concepts, or even programs is not new. However,
                   difficulties arise when large amounts of inter-related
                   information are shared by groups of people. This paper
                   describes an organisation based on perspectives that
                   aids in structuring hy pertext. Perspectives provide a
                   uniform model for views, versions and contexts --- and
                   can be composed via perspective operations. After a
                   brief introduction where we motivate the need for
                   structuring mechanisms within hypertext, we give a more
                   rigorous description of the model be hind perspectives
                   and the operations that can be performed on them. We
                   then present a number of examples that demonstrate that

                   crucial to know their architecture. The first problem
                   is that unlike classes and packages, architecture is
                   not explicitly represented in the code. The second
                   problem is that successful applications evolve over
                   time, so their architecture inevitably drifts.
                   Reconstructing the architecture and checking whether it
                   is still valid is therefore an important aid. While
                   there is a plethora of approaches and techniques
                   supporting architecture reconstruction, there is no
                   comprehensive state of the art and it is often
                   difficult to compare the approaches. This article

  abstract       = {Present-day applications are increasingly required to
                   be flexible, or "open" in a variety of ways. By
                   flexibility we mean that these applications have to be
                   portable (to different hardware and software
                   platforms), interoperable (with other applications),
                   extendible (to new functionality), configurable (to
                   individual users' or clients' needs), and maintainable.
                   These kinds of flexibility are currently best supported
                   by component-oriented software technology: components,
                   by means of abstraction, support portability,
                   interoperability, and maintainability. Extendibility
                   and configurability are supported by different forms of
                   binding technology, or "glue": application parts, or
                   even whole applications can be created by composing
                   software components; applications stay flexible by
                   allowing components to be replaced or reconfigured,
                   possibly at runtime. This thesis develops a formal
                   language for software composition that is based on the
                   Pi-calculus. More precisely, we present the L-calculus,
                   a variant of the Pi-calculus in which agents
                   communicate by passing extensible, labeled records, or
                   so-called "forms", rather than tuples. This approach
                   makes it much easier to model compositional
                   abstractions than it is possible in the plain
                   Pi-calculus, since the contents of communication are
                   now independent of position, agents are more naturally
                   polymorphic since communication forms can be easily
                   extended, and environmental arguments can be passed
                   implicitly. The L-calculus is developed in three
                   stages: (i) we analyse whether the Pi-calculus is
                   suitable to model composition abstractions, (ii) driven
                   by the insights we got using the Pi-calculus, we de ne
                   a new calculus that has better support for software
                   composition (e.g., provides support for inherently
                   extensible software construction), and (iii), we de ne
                   a first-order type system with subtype polymorphism and
                   sound record concatenation that allows us to check
                   statically an agent system in order to prevent the
                   occurrences of run-time errors. We conclude with
                   defining a first Java-based composition system and
                   Piccola, a prototype composition language based on the
                   L-calculus. The composition system provides support for
                   integrating arbitrary compositional abstractions using
                   both Piccola and standard bridging technologies like
                   RMI and CORBA. Furthermore, the composition systems
                   maintains a composition library that provides
                   components in a uniform way.},

                   systems is gaining importance in software industry,
                   because the accelerated turnover in software companies
                   creates legacy systems in a shorter period of time.
                   Especially understanding classes is a key activity in
                   object-oriented programming, since classes represent
                   the primary abstractions from which applications are
                   built. The main problem of this task is to quickly
                   grasp the purpose of a class and its inner structure.
                   To help the reverse engineers in their first contact
                   with a foreign system, we propose a categorization of
                   classes based on the visualization of their internal
                   structure. The contributions of this paper are a novel
                   categorization of classes and a visualization of the
                   classes which we call the class blueprint. We have
                   validated the categorization on several case studies,
                   two of which we present here.},

                   implementations from generic components, thus
                   reconciling the often opposing goals of genericity and
                   efficiency. This technique has proved useful within the
                   domains of imperative, functional, and logical
                   languages, but so far has not been explored within the
                   domain of object-oriented languages. We present
                   experiments in the specialization of {Java} programs.
                   We demonstrate how to construct a program specializer
                   for {Java} programs from an existing specializer for C
                   programs and a {Java}-to-C compiler. Specialization is
                   managed using a declarative approach that abstracts
                   over the optimization process and masks implementation
                   details. Our experiments show that program
                   specialization provides a four-time speedup of an
                   image-filtering program. Based on these experiments, we
                   identify optimizations of object-oriented programs that
                   can be carried out by automatic program specialization.
                   We argue that program specialization is useful in the
                   field of software components, allowing a generic
                   component to be specialized to a specific
                   configuration.},

                   supporting concurrency and identify six categories of
                   concurrent object-oriented languages. Then, we review
                   several concurrent object-oriented languages and

                   systems have become an essential component in
                   collaborative software development. One such version
                   control system that has found generous adoption in
                   recent years is Subversion, a centralized system that
                   was designed explicitly to match the requirements of
                   the open-source community. Equally, specialized web
                   based tools have emerged to browse and inspect version
                   control systems such as Subversion and have proven
                   themselves to be valuable instruments for the
                   developers of software projects. As projects become
                   larger and more complex however, these tools have often
                   reached their limitations on the level of introspecting
                   they can provide. To solve this problem we present
                   Shrew, an approach to analyze Subversion repositories
                   that builds upon a specialized meta-model and makes use
                   of the Moose object- oriented reengineering environment
                   to facilitate information extraction and that presents
                   its results with a convenient web interface.},

                   M\"oglichkeit ein Programm auf der Microsoft Win32
                   Plattform zu \"ubersetzen, ohne das Programm zu
                   ver\"andern. Dies bedeutet, dass alle auf dem
                   Bildschirm angezeigten Texte in eine andere Sprache als
                   urspr\"unglich vorgesehen. Zudem hat man mit die
                   M\"oglichkeit Texte aus einem Programm auszulesen, um
                   die \"Ubersetzung zu vereinfachen. Um das
                   Gesch\"aftsbereich der \"Ubersetzungssysteme zu
                   erweitern, wollte die TeTrade die M\"oglichkeit eines

                   der Name JMLS, Multi Language System for Java, gegeben.

                   system includes its reverse engineering, i.e. their
                   internal structure and behaviour needs to be
                   understood. Many researchers proposed different
                   techniques to support this work by static code or
                   dynamic behaviour analysis. Whereas the static code
                   analysis does not explore the behaviour of the running
                   system, the data collection for the dynamic behaviour
                   analysis produces a large amount of data.\\ In this
                   thesis we propose a novel visualization technique which
                   combines static code with dynamic behaviour analysis.
                   This technique supports the software engineer to
                   understand the behaviour of software systems by
                   visualizing it on the basis of the internal structure.
                   Using this technique we focus on features, their
                   detection within the source code, hotspots of behaviour
                   and feature interaction as methods to understand how
                   different features behave in the target software

  abstract       = {Inheritance is the fundamental reuse mechanism in
                   object-oriented programming languages; its most
                   prominent variants are single inheritance, multiple
                   inheritance, and mixin inheritance. In the first part
                   of this paper, we identify and illustrate the
                   conceptual and practical reusability problems that
                   arise with these forms of inheritance. We then present
                   a simple compositional model for structuring
                   object-oriented programs, which we call traits. Traits
                   are essentially groups of methods that serve as
                   building blocks for classes and are primitive units of
                   code reuse. In this model, classes are composed from a
                   set of traits by specifying glue code that connects the
                   traits together and accesses the necessary state. We
                   demonstrate how traits overcome the problems arising
                   with the different variants of inheritance, we discuss
                   how traits can be implemented effectively, and we
                   summarize our experience applying traits to refactor an
                   existing class hierarchy.},

                   constructing an operating system and its kernel with
                   object-oriented technology. We first propose
                   object/metaobject separation, a means of constructing
                   an object-oriented operating system and its kernel.
                   This method divides the implementing system facilities
                   and applications into two types: objects and
                   metaobjects. This paper presents the concept of
                   object/metaobject separation and discusses why
                   object/metaobject separation is required in terms of
                   limitations in the micro-kernel and object-oriented
                   technologies. We also discuss an example of using
                   object/metaobject separation as implemented in Apertos.
                   This paper then proposes mechanisms which efficiently
                   implement object/metaobject separation. These are
                   characterized by meta-level context management, and are
                   implemented in the Apertos operating system. Meta-level
                   context management is designed to reduce the overhead
                   of control transfer between an object and its
                   metaspace. Here, metaobjects reflectors, MetaCore,
                   Context, and Activity are introduced to represent the
                   metahierarchy of an object's execution. Finally, we
                   present the evaluation results of the Apertos
                   implementation, and discuss the relationship with
                   previous work.},

                   Entity},

  Type           = {Master's thesis},
  abstract       = {Software systems undergo continual change if they want
                   to remain useful over time. However, only limited
                   support for change is offered by current programming
                   languages and development environments. Although
                   various existing efforts try to cope with change and
                   exploit it for different applications, a unifying
                   approach to support software change is missing. We
                   propose Changeboxes as a generic metamodel to represent
                   change as a first-class entity. Changeboxes encapsulate
                   the semantics of a change process as well as its
                   effects and model the entire change history of a
                   software system. Changeboxes capture changes at the
                   level of the runtime system and the integrated
                   development environment. They are able to record
                   low-level changes as well as complex transformations
                   like refactorings. Each Changebox provides a scope for
                   dynamic execution, whereas several ones can be
                   concurrently active and thus enable different views of
                   the same software artifact within a single running
                   system. Changeboxes can be arbitrarily extended, which
                   enables one to explore several development trails
                   simultaneously. Multiple Changeboxes may be merged in
                   order to combine their changes depending on a
                   customizable conflict resolution strategy. Our
                   proof-of-concept implementation showed to have an
                   acceptable performance and was used to demonstrate the
                   impact of Changeboxes on various domains. We discuss
                   the advantages that Changeboxes entail for evolving
                   software systems and propose selected topics for
                   further research.},

                   fundamental abstractions for coordinating communicating
                   agents. At the same time, researchers continue to
                   propose new variants of tuple spaces, since no one
                   approach seems to be universally applicable to all
                   problem domains. Some models offer a certain
                   configurability, but existing approaches generally stop
                   at afixed set of configuration options and static
                   configuration at instantiation time. We argue that a
                   more open approach is needed, and present OpenSpaces,
                   an object-oriented framework that supports static
                   configurability through subclassing across several
                   dimensions, as well as dynamic configurability of
                   policies through runtime composition. We introduce
                   OpenSpaces by showing how it can be used to instantiate
                   a typical application, and we present an overview of
                   the framework, implemented in Smalltalk, detailing the
                   various degrees of configurability.},

                   to perform a set of operations on electronic forms.
                   Actions are triggered automatically when forms or
                   combinations of forms arrive at particular nodes in the
                   network of stations. The actions deal with operations
                   on forms. This paper discusses the facilities provided

                   procedures and sketches their implementation. },

  abstract       = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose
                   classes from reusable components while avoiding
                   problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance
                   and mixins. Traits as originally proposed are
                   \emph{stateless}, that is, they contain only methods,
                   but no instance variables. State can only be accessed
                   within traits by accessors, which become \emph{required
                   methods} of the trait. Although this approach works
                   reasonably well in practice, it means that many traits,
                   viewed as software components, are artificially
                   \emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may
                   contain significant amounts of boilerplate glue code.
                   Although these limitations are largely mitigated by
                   proper tool support, we seek a cleaner solution that
                   supports \emph{stateful traits}. The key difficulty is
                   how to handle conflicts that arise when composed traits
                   contribute instance variables whose names clash. We
                   present a solution that is faithful to the guiding
                   principle of stateless traits: \emph{the client retains
                   control of the composition}. Stateful traits consist of
                   a minimal extension to stateless traits in which
                   instance variables are purely local to the scope of a
                   trait, unless they are explicitly made accessible by
                   the composing client of a trait. Naming conflicts are
                   avoided, and variables of disjoint traits can be
                   explicitly merged by clients. We discuss and compare
                   two implementation strategies, and briefly present a
                   case study in which stateful traits have been used to
                   refactor the trait-based version of the Smalltalk
                   collection hierarchy.},

                   do not make the concepts of unit-testing explicit in

                   assigning typings to terms in the calculus. Types meant
                   to describe the kind of messages an object may receive
                   are assigned to the free names in a program resulting
                   in a scenario where a program is assigned multiple
                   name-type pairs, constituting a typing for the process.
                   Programs that comply to the typing discipline are shown
                   not to suffer from runtime errors. Furthermore the
                   calculus possesses a notation of principal typings,
                   from which all typings that make a program well-typed

  abstract       = {When reengineering legacy systems, it is crucial to
                   assess if the legacy behavior has been preserved or how
                   it changed due to the reengineering effort. Ideally if
                   a legacy system is covered by tests, running the tests
                   on the new version can identify potential differences
                   or discrepancies. However, writing tests for an unknown
                   and large system is difficult due to the lack of
                   internal knowledge. It is especially difficult to bring
                   the system to an appropriate state. Our solution is
                   based on the acknowledgment that one of the few
                   trustable piece of information available when
                   approaching a legacy system is the running system
                   itself. Our approach reifies the execution traces and
                   uses logic programming to express tests on them.
                   Thereby it eliminates the need to programatically bring
                   the system in a particular state, and handles the
                   test-writer a high-level abstraction mechanism to query
                   the trace. The resulting system, called TESTLOG, was
                   used on several real-world case studies to validate our
                   claims.},

                   variety of different object-oriented paradigms within a
                   unified and simple framework. Starting from a kernel
                   language whose foundation is the simply typed
                   $\lambda$-calculus, we develop a small collection of
                   environment manipulating primitives that provide an
                   expressive platform within which a number of
                   inheritance-related abstractions can be realized.},

                   its programming environment and tools. First introduced
                   more than 20 years ago, the Smalltalk browser enables
                   programmers to ``home in'' on particular methods using
                   a hierarchy of manually-defined classifications. By its
                   nature, this classification scheme says a lot about the
                   desired state of the code, but little about the actual
                   state of the code as it is being developed. We have
                   extended the Smalltalk browser with dynamically
                   computed virtual categories that dramatically improve
                   the browser's support for incremental programming. We
                   illustrate these improvements by example, and describe

                   extraction requires a non-trivial effort, and (2) the
                   results depend on the heuristics used during
                   extraction. These challenges burden researchers that
                   are new to the community and make it difficult to
                   benchmark software repository mining since it is almost
                   impossible to reproduce experiments done by another
                   team. In this paper we present the TA-RE corpus. TA-RE
                   collects extracted data from software repositories in
                   order to build a collection of projects that will
                   simplify extraction process. Additionally the
                   collection can be used for benchmarking. As the first
                   step we propose an exchange language capable of making
                   sharing and reusing data as simple as possible.},

  Title          = {A Scenario Based Approach for Refactoring Duplicated
                   Code in Object Oriented Systems},
  School         = {University of Bern},
  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {Code duplication is one of the factors that severely
                   complicates the maintenance and evolution of large
                   software systems. Tools exist that allow detection of
                   duplicated code. Technics to change, correct and
                   improve code exist also. But it is difficult to find
                   programs that work between both domains. In this work,
                   we discuss a scenario based approach to analyze,
                   categorize and remove duplicated code in an object
                   oriented context. The scenario is defined as the
                   relationship between classes containing methods where
                   the duplications were found. A prototype framework,
                   SUPREMO, has been developed to validate our approach.
                   It is characterized by the following aspect: (a)
                   Visualization of the scenario in a graphical global
                   context that gives the developer the possibility to see
                   the impact of the duplication. (b) Visualization of the
                   source code in a textual viewer where a pop-up menu
                   gives the user the opportunity to refactor. Nine case
                   studies (seven written in Smalltalk, one in C++ and one
                   in Java) are analyzed. A presentation of statistical
                   results and a discussion about the qualitative aspect
                   of three applications developed in the SCG group are
                   presented. The qualitative validation is illustrated
                   with a list of examples that simulate the functioning
                   of SUPREMO.},

  Title          = {Scripting f{\"u}r {CORBA}},
  School         = {University of Bern},
  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {Verteilte Applikationen stellen hohe Anforderungen an
                   die Software-Hersteller, da diese Applikationen sehr
                   schnell sehr komplex werden, unzureichende
                   Entwicklungswerkzeuge haben und einen hohen
                   Administrationsaufwand verursachen. Zur Unterst\"utzung
                   werden heutzutage oft Middleware- Technologien
                   eingesetzt, wie zum Beispiel DCOM, RMI oder CORBA. In
                   dieser Arbeit wird CORBA analysiert und mit Hilfe eines
                   in dieser Arbeit erstellten Verbesserungsansatzes und
                   einer Skript-Sprache zu einem Komponenten Framework
                   verbessert. CORBA ist eine Middleware f\"ur verteilte,
                   heterogene Applikationen und verspricht die
                   Unabh\"angigkeit von Programmiersprache sowie eine
                   transparente Verteilung von Objekten. CORBA hat einige
                   Schwachstellen, wie zum Beispiel die mangelhafte
                   Flexibilit\"at, die mit hohem Aufwand verbundene
                   Erweiterbarkeit oder das aufwendige Testen. In der
                   Informationstechnologie gibt es heute viele, schnelle
                   Ver\"anderungen, was ein hohes Mass an Flexibilit\"at
                   und Erweiterbar- beziehungsweise Ver\"anderbarkeit der
                   Software erfordert. In dieser Arbeit wird gezeigt, dass
                   eine Middleware, wie CORBA, durch einen einfachen
                   Verbesserungsansatz, der Komponenten-Proxy-Methode,
                   wesentlich verbessert werden kann. Mit Hilfe dieser
                   Methode und der verwendeten Skript-Sprache Python wird
                   ein Komponenten Framework erstellt, das die Verwendung
                   von verteilten Komponenten wesentlich flexibler macht.
                   Durch dieses Framework wird eine h\"ohere Abstraktion
                   der Applikationen erreicht, da die Applikationslogik
                   von den Komponenten getrennt werden kann und die
                   Komponenten durch Scripting verbunden werden. Dadurch
                   entstehen allgemeinere Komponenten, die einfacher
                   wiederverwendet werden k\"onnen. Die
                   Komponenten-Proxy-Methode f\"ordert zudem die
                   Einsatzm\"oglichkeiten von CORBA. Es werden Ans\"atze
                   f\"ur einen 'travelling agent' und einen 'intelligent
                   proxy' gezeigt.},

                   help in reverse engineering large object-oriented
                   legacy systems, we proposed a hybrid approach combining
                   the immediate appeal of visualisations with the
                   scalability of metrics. However, our approach lacked of
                   a methodology that guides the reverse engineer. In this
                   paper we present a first methodology that we developed
                   from our industrial experiments.},

                   program, where each concept represents a potential
                   module. We define the notion of a concept partition,

  Title          = {Virtual Hypertext Based on Paths and Warm Links},
  Institution    = {vub},
  abstract       = {Throughout the last years a huge amount of work has
                   been devoted to the definition of hypertext models.
                   Even more resources have been directed towards the
                   domain of virtual (dynamic/ computational) hypertext,
                   among others motivated by the idea of building open
                   systems. Surprisingly enough, almost nobody stressed
                   the role of the underlying model in such virtual
                   systems. That is precisely the aim of this text: to
                   define a general hypertext model that is able to
                   support the notion of virtuality. Our assertion is that
                   the combination of the ancient concepts 'Paths' and
                   'Warm Links' provide just the extra support needed.
                   Moreover this allows for a model where links are but
                   one of the possible ways to relate nodes. While
                   experimenting with the model, an interesting question
                   arose: do bi-directional links fit into a virtual model
                   ? This paper attempts to answer the question. We chose
                   a constructive approach, because our aim was to create
                   a laboratory where ideas concerning virtual hypertext
                   might be explored. We applied recent viewpoints from
                   the field of software engineering (namely object
                   oriented frameworks and mixins) to assist the iterative
                   design process. In order to show the value of the work,
                   we have implemented two prototype applications. The
                   first is a browser for viewing (Smalltalk) source code
                   which includes query facilities, the second is an
                   electronic agenda. These experiments demonstrate three
                   desired properties of the model: the applicability
                   (considering the differences between the prototypes),
                   the open endedness (since it is able to establish
                   hypertext structures on top of underlying foreign
                   constructions) and the extensibility (while building
                   the applications, we continued to expand the model).},

  abstract       = {In our life we often use examples to explain difficult
                   topics. Examples help us to comprehend the problem. An
                   example is easier to understand than an abstract
                   description of the problem. In software design the
                   problems are complex and abstract. But examples are
                   rarely used to explain a complicated situation. We are
                   using examples to document and explain software.
                   Examples demonstrate the creation and behavior of an
                   instance. They can be reused to compose new examples.
                   Examples can be extended with assertions and become
                   unit tests. Because the link between test and method
                   under test is often missing, we created a meta-model
                   for tests. Our meta-model stores the objects, methods
                   and parameters used for the tests. It can generate the
                   source code of its tests which is human readable. First
                   studies shows that most unit tests are method tests
                   concerning only a single method call. The other tests
                   can be refactored to method tests. We built an editor
                   for the meta-model to create examples and tests. The
                   editor is integrated in the environment and lets the
                   developer create new tests with a minimal effort.},

  abstract       = {This paper proposes an extension of the notion of
                   method as it is currently used in most object-oriented
                   languages. We define polymethods as methods that we can
                   attach directly to types, as opposed to classes and
                   that we can describe with a second-order type. Two
                   benefits result from this extension; first, the
                   expressive power of the language is improved with
                   better modeling abilities. Next, second-order types
                   yield a more powerful (precise) type inference, which
                   extends the range of static type checking in a truly
                   extensible object-oriented language. We first show that
                   extensible object-oriented languages present many
                   difficulties for static type-checking and that
                   second-order types are necessary to get stronger
                   type-checking. We illustrate how to combine polymethods
                   through type inheritance and propose a technique based
                   on abstract interpretation to derive a second-order
                   type for new polymethods.},

                   is done at a rela- tively low abstraction level,
                   leaving a large gap with the high abstraction level of
                   a de- sign. This makes the use of a framework
                   difficult, and allows design and realization to
                   diverge. Design patterns are more specific elements of
                   design, and thus reduce this gap. We even bridge this
                   gap by making design patterns and the classes that play
                   a role within them into special purpose software
                   components. System realization becomes a matter of
                   composing special purpose class-components. We also
                   introduce a system, FACE, which supports the visual
                   composition of such specifications.},

                   in one part of the code may risk adversely affecting
                   other features. Feature implementation and
                   relationships between features are not explicit in the
                   code. To address this problem, we propose an
                   interactive 3D visualization technique based on a
                   combination of static and dynamic analysis which
                   enables the software developer to step through visual
                   representations of execution traces. We visualize
                   dynamic behaviors of execution traces in terms of
                   object creations and interactions and represent this in
                   the context of a static class-hierarchy view of a
                   system. We describe how we apply our approach to a case
                   study to visualize and identify common parts of the
                   code that are active during feature execution. },

                   organizing software into reusable components. There
                   have been several attempts to adapt and extend this
                   paradigm to the programming of concurrent and
                   distributed applications. Hybrid is a language whose
                   design attempts to retain multiple inheritance,
                   genericity and strong-typing, and incorporate a notion
                   of active objects. Objects in Hybrid are potentially
                   active entities that communicate with one another
                   through a message-passing protocol loosely based on
                   remote procedure calls. Non-blocking calls and delay
                   queues are the two basic mechanisms for interleaving
                   and scheduling activities. A prototype implementation
                   of a compiler and run-time system for Hybrid have been
                   completed. We shall review aspects of the language
                   design and attempt to evaluate its shortcomings. We
                   conclude with a list of requirements that we pose as a
                   challenge for the design of future concurrent

                   application can reduce the effort of producing
                   specifications and improve their quality. The paper
                   presents the requirement specification phase for
                   object-oriented applications under a reuse approach.
                   Object-oriented specifications are reused by accessing
                   a repository of reusable components and by adapting
                   them to the application requirements. A model for
                   specifications reuse based on the composition approach
                   is presented; the model is also used to encode
                   development knowledge guiding in the specification
                   activity. Specification reuse is supported by a tool to
                   select reusable components and to guide the developer
                   in tailoring the components to the needs of a specific
                   application. The RECAST tool (REquirement Composition
                   And Specification Tool) presented in the paper has
                   functionalities for retrieving reusable components from
                   a repository and functionalities driving the
                   composition and tailoring activities, on the basis of

                   Reverse engineering is a complex analysis that usually
                   involves combining different techniques and tools.
                   Moreover, oftentimes the existing tools are not
                   perfectly suitable for the task, and customization of
                   existing tools, or development of new tools is
                   required. Moose is an extensible reengineering
                   environment designed to provide the necessary
                   infrastructure for tool integration. Moose centers on a
                   language independent meta-model, and offers services

  abstract       = {\fIPersistent\fR object systems are highly-valued
                   technology because they offer an effective foundation
                   for building very long-lived \fIpersistent application
                   systems\fR (PAS). The technology becomes more effective
                   as it offers a more consistently integrated
                   computational context. For it to be feasible to design
                   and construct a PAS it must be possible to
                   incrementally add program and data to the existing
                   collection. For a PAS to endure it must offer
                   flexibility: a capacity to evolve and change. This
                   paper examines the capacity of persistent object
                   systems to accommodate incremental construction and
                   change. Established store based technologies can
                   support incremental construction but methodologies are
                   needed to deploy them effectively. Evolving data
                   description is one motivation for inheritance but
                   inheritance alone is not enough to support change
                   management. The case for supporting incremental change
                   is very persuasive. The challenge is to provide
                   technologies that will facilitate it and methodologies
                   that will organize it. This paper identifies change
                   absorbers as a means of describing how changes should
                   propagate. It is argued that if we systematically
                   develop an adequate repertoire of change absorbers then
                   they will facilitate much better quality change
                   management.},

                   performance bottleneck if inter-language bridging is
                   frequent. Piccola is a pure composition language that
                   wraps components according to a specific composition
                   style. This wrapping must be efficient, since even
                   arithmetic operations are done by external components.
                   In this paper we present how to use partial evaluation
                   to overcome much of the overhead associated with the
                   wrapping. It turns out that Piccola scripts can be
                   highly optimized since form expression exhibit the
                   right kind of information to separate side effects from
                   services and resolve internal dependencies.},

                   use programming patterns to clarify their intents and
                   to increase the understandability of their programs.
                   Unfortunately, most software development environments
                   do not adequately supp ort the declaration and use of
                   such patterns. To explicitly codify these patterns, we
                   adopt a declarative meta programming approach. In this
                   approach, we reify the structure of an
                   (object-oriented) program in terms of logic clauses. We
                   declare programmi ng patterns as logic rules on top of
                   these clauses. By querying the logic system, these
                   rules allow us to check, enforce and search for
                   occurrences of certain patterns in the software. As
                   such, the programming patterns become an active part of
                   the softw are development and maintenance environment.},

                   source programs is essential. Tools in such

                   integrated fashion around the database. In addition,
                   new programming techniques and the acquisition of
                   knowledge through experience create a need for
                   extensions. Such environments have to be designed so

                   is a challenge, since end users are domain experts but
                   still have concrete requirements. In this master thesis
                   we present how we used a meta-driven approach to
                   support the end user customization of Web applications.
                   We present Magritte, a recursive meta-data meta-model
                   integrated into the Smalltalk reflective meta-model.
                   The adaptive model of Magritte enables to not only
                   describe existing classes but also let end users build
                   their own meta-models on the fly. Further on we
                   describe how meta-interpreters automatically build
                   views, reports, validating editors and persistency
                   mechanisms. As a complete example of how we applied a
                   meta-model to a Web application we present Pier, the
                   second version of a fully object-oriented
                   implementation of a content management system and Wiki
                   engine. Pier is implemented with objects from the top
                   to the bottom and is designed to be customizable to
                   accommodate new needs. The integration of a powerful
                   meta-description layer makes it a breeze to extend the
                   running system with new functionality without having to
                   patch the core engine. We describe the lessons learned
                   from using the Magritte meta-model to build
                   applications. Both projects described in this thesis

  Address        = {Berne},
  abstract       = {Within object-oriented systems there are different
                   meaningful dependencies between different objects.
                   These dependencies reveal ``contracts",
                   ``collaborations" and ``relationships" between classes,
                   methods, packages and any development unit in the
                   systems. In most of the cases, these dependencies are
                   not explicit in the code. This problem is due to
                   inadequate or out-of-date documentation and mechanisms
                   such as dynamic binding, inheritance and polymorphism
                   that obscure the presence of existing dependencies.
                   These dependencies play an important part in implicit
                   contracts between the various software artifacts of the
                   system. It is therefore essential that a developer, who
                   has to make changes or extensions to an object-oriented
                   system, understands the dependencies among the classes.
                   Lack of understanding increases the risk that seemingly
                   innocuous changes break the implicit existing contracts
                   in the system. In short, implicit, undocumented
                   dependencies lead to ``fragile systems" that are
                   difficult to extend or modify correctly. In this thesis
                   we develop an approach -- based on a methodology and a
                   tool support -- to recover this implicit information
                   and generate ``high-level views" of a system at
                   different abstraction levels, using a formal clustering
                   technique called Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). With
                   these views, we help to build the first mental model of
                   a system. Thus the implicit or lost information is made
                   explicit and we are able to find uses of coding styles,
                   possible bottlenecks and weakpoints of a system,
                   identify eventual contracts between the entities,
                   ``patterns" based on the dependencies and -- if
                   possible -- propose possible solutions to correct

  abstract       = {Due to the size and the extreme complexity of legacy
                   systems, it is nearly impossible to write from scratch
                   tests before refactoring them. In addition
                   object-oriented legacy systems present specific
                   requirements to test them. Indeed late-binding allow
                   subclasses to change fundamental aspects of the
                   superclass code and in particular call flows. Moreover
                   Object-oriented programming promotes a distribution of
                   the responsibilities to multiple entities leading to
                   complex scenario to be tested. In such a context one of
                   the few trustable source of information is the
                   execution of the application itself. Traditional
                   forward engineering approaches such as unit testing do
                   not really provide adequate solution to this problem.
                   Therefore there is a need for a more expressive way of
                   testing the execution of object-oriented applications.
                   We propose to represent the trace of object-oriented
                   applications as logic facts and express tests over the
                   trace. This way complex sequences of message exchanges,
                   sequence matching, or expression of negative
                   information are expressed in compact form. We validated
                   our approach by implementing TestLog a prototype tool
                   and testing the Moose reengineering environment and a
                   meta-interpreter.},

  abstract       = {A \fItransverse activity\fR is an activity executed by
                   several objects in some combination. The activity is
                   described as a single unit, separately from the
                   descriptions of the participating objects. A transverse
                   activity is described and executed by using the usual
                   object-centric actions, i.e. the methods of the
                   objects, and is seen as a natural supplement to the
                   description of the cooperation of active objects.
                   Transverse activities support the modeling of our
                   conceptual understanding of combined activities. Our
                   conceptual understanding not only includes the
                   recognition of usual components but also the
                   recognition of activities combined from the individual
                   actions of such components. We are used to recognize
                   components as phenomena, but transverse activities are
                   phenomena also and these activities may be classified,
                   specialized, and aggregated, i.e. abstraction in this
                   sense is possible also for such activities. The
                   description of a transverse activity must at least
                   include a listing of the components participating in
                   the activity and a listing of the sequence of actions
                   making up the combined directive of the activity. In
                   the specialization or aggregation of activities by
                   means of other activities both the participants and the
                   directive can be included in these forms of abstraction
                   to support the underlying intention of transverse
                   activities. Usual language mechanisms such as class,
                   object etc. in various forms are used to model
                   phenomena and concepts. A ongoing revision and
                   extension of such usual object-oriented language
                   mechanisms is necessary to be able to model, directly
                   and naturally, additional differentiating elements of
                   conceptual understanding, such as e.g. transverse
                   activities. Transverse activities are illustrated and
                   motivated by means of several minor fragments of a
                   complex example and an conceptual understanding of
                   transverse activities is outlined. Language mechanisms
                   supporting the classification, specialization, and
                   aggregation of transverse activities is defined by
                   means of special activity-classes and -objects. Various
                   possibilities for adding new and powerful features as
                   part of such mechanisms are discussed. The meaning of
                   the execution of activity-objects in relation to the
                   execution of the components involved in the activity is
                   defined in terms of interleaved execution.},

                   conformance defined in terms of the possible
                   interactions between an object and its clients. We
                   relate interaction conformance to known equivalence
                   relations between communicating concurrent agents, and
                   we show that, by viewing types as certain kinds of
                   indeterminate agents, interaction conformance gives us
                   a subtype relationship. We briefly explore the

                   procedure call, and on the notion of activities, which
                   capture a single-thread flow of control between

                   for constructing atomic actions and concurrent
                   subactivities. We show how these mechanisms can be used

                   the implicit dependencies that define contracts that
                   must be respected by changes to the software. Formal
                   Concept Analysis is a well-established technique for
                   identifying groups of elements with common sets of
                   properties. We have successfully applied FCA to complex
                   software systems in order to automatically discover a
                   variety of different kinds of implicit, recurring sets
                   of dependencies amongst design artifacts. In this paper
                   we describe our approach, outline three case studies,
                   and draw various lessons from our experiences. In

                   dass beim n\"achsten Suchen der Aufwand minimal ist.
                   Sucht man aber in fremden Dokumenten, muss man sich

                   and coordination models and languages for the
                   specification and construction of concurrent
                   object-oriented systems. Active objects are objects
                   integrating concurrency and coordination models and
                   languages are models and languages that specify the way
                   the active objects composing the systems are glued
                   together. Our approach is based on the definition of a
                   coordination model and language called CoLaS for the
                   specification of the coordination aspect in concurrent
                   object-oriented systems based on active objects. The
                   CoLaS coordination model and language introduces a high
                   level coordination abstraction called Coordination
                   Group that allows programmers to design, to specify, to
                   implement and to validate the coordination of groups of
                   collaborating active objects in concurrent

                   with great success for some time. But the techniques of
                   object-oriented programming have been largely confined
                   to the single address space, and have not been
                   applicable to distributed systems. Recent advances in
                   language technology have allowed a change in the way
                   distributed systems are constructed that does allow
                   real object-oriented programming on the network. But
                   these advances also change some of our most basic
                   conceptions about the relationship between processor
                   and code, and what it is that constitutes a computer.
                   We will argue that a new computing architecture, based
                   around the ideas of the network and full
                   object-orientation, will soon become the dominant
                   computing architecture, allowing us to tie together
                   large numbers of devices but requiring that we think
                   and design in entirely new ways.},

                   calls for clear definitions, frequently there exist
                   many contradicting definitions of the same metric
                   depending on the implementation language. We suggest to
                   express and define metrics using a language-independent
                   metamodel based on graphs. This graph-based approach
                   allows for an unambiguous definition of generic
                   object-oriented metrics and higher-order metrics. We

                   gained in the functional and object-oriented ``worlds''
                   and attempts to bring these worlds together in a

                   examples which illustrate how functions and objects can

                   fundamental goal of object-oriented concurrent
                   programming languages, there is only limited support
                   for their specification and abstraction at the language
                   level. This leads to a mismatch between conceptional
                   designs, using high-level abstractions, and the
                   implementation, using the low-level coordination
                   constructs. Often coordination is hard-wired into the
                   components they coordinate, which leads to evolution,
                   maintenance and composibility problems. We propose a
                   model called FLO/C that relies on the notion of
                   connectors. A connector is an entity that enforces the
                   coordination of the entities it coordinates. This model
                   supports a clear separation between the coordinated
                   active objects and their coordination. An active object
                   only defines specific domain information and a
                   connector only defines coordination between a group of
                   active objects (its participants). The coordination is
                   abstractly defined refering to components in terms of
                   the object interface. Coordination and coordinated
                   entities are independant and can evolve separately.
                   Coordination can be composed and replaced easily.},

                   reusability or on strong-typing, but weak on
                   concurrency. In response to this gap, we are developing
                   Hybrid, an object-oriented language in which objects
                   are the active entities. Objects in Hybrid are
                   organized into domains, and concurrent executions into
                   activities. All object communications are based on
                   remote procedure-calls. Unstructured sends and accepts
                   are forbidden. To this the mechanisms of delegation and
                   delay queues are added to enable switching and
                   triggering of activities. Concurrent subactivities and
                   atomic actions are provided for compactness and
                   simplicity. We show how solutions to many important
                   concurrent problems, such a pipelining, constraint
                   management and ``administration'' can be compactly
                   expressed using these mechanisms.},

  abstract       = {Reusability is widely believed to be a key to
                   improving software development productivity. However,
                   in practice, effective reuse is more an achievement of
                   good development environments than a strategy for
                   software development. It seems natural that a reduction
                   of the effort needed for reuse should have a positive
                   impact on reuse. Among the various lines of attack that
                   may lead to a reduction of the reuse effort, we address
                   the problem of finding and understanding reusable
                   functionality in an object-oriented software
                   environment. This paper presents the Affinity Browser,
                   a selection and exploration tool based on the notion of
                   affinity between objects. The user is presented with a
                   two dimensional display where the objects are displayed
                   in such a way that their relative positions convey
                   their affinity i.e., objects lying closer together are
                   more strongly related than objects lying farther apart.
                   The browser provides for different views of the
                   relationships among objects. Each view is based on a
                   different measure of affinity and thus portrays a
                   different relationship. We discuss the rationale behind
                   the Affinity Browser tool and discuss the way users can
                   take advantage of it to understand the functionality
                   provided by a set of classes. The Affinity Browser's
                   ability to help understanding relationships between
                   objects will be illustrated by two examples of view
                   construction.},

                   frameworks do not live up to their expectations of
                   rapid application development or non-programming-expert
                   application development. They fall short when compared
                   to component-oriented development environments in which
                   applications are built with components that have a
                   strong affinity with the problem domain (i.e. being
                   domain-specific). Although the latter environments are
                   very powerful, they are hard to build and, in general,
                   do not allow much variation in the problem domain that
                   is covered. In this paper we show how this apparent
                   conflict between generality and domain specificity can
                   be overcome by considering application building itself
                   as the problem domain. This naturally leads to the
                   notion of a reflective application builder, i.e. an
                   application framework-application builder pair that
                   incorporates all the tools for the visual construction
                   of (domain-specific) application builders.},

  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {Tool support is needed to cope with the complexity and
                   the large amounts of infor-mation in reverse
                   engineering. By creating representations in another
                   form, often at a higher level of abstraction,
                   state-of-the-art tools aid in reducing complexity and
                   gaining insights into parts of a system's structure.
                   However, orientation and navigation among these
                   representations remains difficult. Often superfluously
                   tool-induced effort is needed to perform a certain
                   task. We call this artificially added effort friction.
                   Tools with the right navigation support can reduce this
                   friction, and increase productivity. This work
                   classifies navigation in models of object-oriented
                   software systems, and shows that among the great number
                   of possibilities, only a few make sense. We determine
                   which kinds of navigation steps are useful, and why. We
                   summarize our experience and best practices of
                   state-of-the-art tools in a set of re-quirements for an
                   ideal reverse engineering tool. As a validation for
                   these requirements, we analyze data about the user's
                   behavior during reverse engineering sessions. To
                   collect that data, and for studying various ways of
                   navigation and orientation, we built MooseNavigator, a
                   prototype reverse engineering navigator.},

                   legacy systems is a complex task due to factors such as
                   late binding and polymorphism. Current approaches
                   extract and use information from the complete execution
                   trace of a system. The sheer size and complexity of
                   such traces make their handling, storage, and analysis
                   difficult. Current software systems which run almost
                   non-stop do not permit such a full analysis. In this
                   paper we present a lightweight approach based on the
                   extraction of a condensed amount of information, e.g.,
                   measurements, that does not require a full trace. Using
                   this condensed information, we propose a visualization
                   approach which allows us to identify and understand
                   certain aspects of the objects' lifetime such as their
                   role played in the creation of other objects and the
                   communication architecture they support.},

                   reusability, establishes a classification of data
                   according to a compatibility relationship. This
                   relationship is usually associated with records.
                   However, compatibility can be defined in other
                   situations, involving for example enumerated types or
                   concrete data types. We argue that the basic
                   requirement for supporting compatibility is an
                   interaction protocol between software components using
                   names instead of positions. Based on this principle, an
                   extension of the lambda calculus is proposed, which
                   combines de Bruijn indices with names. In the extended
                   calculus various subtyping situations mentioned above
                   can be modelled; in particular, records are encoded in
                   a straightforward way. Compatibility is formally
                   defined in terms of an operational lattice based on
                   observation of error generation. Unlike many usual
                   orderings, errors are not identified with divergence;
                   as a matter of fact, both are even opposite since they
                   respectively correspond to the bottom and top elements
                   of the lattice. Finally, we briefly explore a second
                   extension of the calculus, providing meet and join
                   operators through a simple operational definition, and
                   opening interesting perspectives for type checking and
                   concurrency.},

  abstract       = {We discuss aspects of inlining of virtual method
                   invocations. First, we introduce a new method test to
                   guard inlinings of such invocations, with a different
                   set of tradeoffs from the class-equality tests proposed
                   previously in the literature. Second, we consider the
                   problem of inlining virtual methods directly, with no
                   guarding test, in dynamic languages such as Self or the
                   {Java} (TM) programming language, whose semantics
                   prohibit a static identification of the complete set of
                   modules that comprise a program. In non-dynamic
                   languages, a whole-program analysis might prove the
                   correctness of a direct virtual inlining. In dynamic
                   languages, however, such analyses can be invalidated by
                   later class loading, and must therefore be treated as
                   assumptions whose later violation must cause
                   recompilation. In the past, such systems have required
                   an on-stack replacement mechanism to update
                   currently-executing invocations of methods containing
                   invalidated inlinings. This paper presents analyses
                   that allow some virtual calls to be inlined directly,
                   while ensuring that invocations in progress may
                   complete safely even if class loading invalidates the
                   inlining for future invocations. This provides the
                   benefits of direct inlining without the need for
                   on-stack replacement, which can be complicated and
                   require space-consuming data structures.},

                   such approaches work well for simple wikis, they hamper

                   and allows collections of methods to be reused by

                   using a trait. It is illustrated by an efficient

                   collaboration is represented by a classbox and a role

                   parts of the system are stable and which have changed
                   more. However, historical analysis implies processing a
                   vast amount of information making the interpretation of
                   the results difficult. To address this issue, we
                   introduce the notion of the history of source code
                   artifacts as a first class entity and define
                   measurements which summarize the evolution of such
                   entities. We use these measurements to define rules by
                   which to detect different characteristics of the
                   evolution of class hierarchies. Furthermore, we discuss
                   the results we obtained by visualizing them using a
                   polymetric view. We apply our approach on two large
                   open source case studies and classify their class

                   identification of objects in legacy code take the data
                   structures as starting point for candidate classes.
                   Unfortunately, legacy data structures tend to grow over
                   time, and may contain many unrelated fields at the time
                   of migration. We propose a method for identifying
                   objects by semi-automatically restructuring the legacy
                   data structures. Issues involved include the selection
                   of record fields of interest, the identification of
                   procedures actually dealing with such fields, and the
                   construction of coherent groups of fields and
                   procedures into candidate classes. We explore the use
                   of cluster and concept analysis for the purpose of
                   object identification, and we illustrate their effect
                   on a 100,000 LOC Cobol system. Furthermore, we use
                   these results to contrast clustering with concept

                   The detection and removal of duplicated code has become
                   a standard activity during the refactoring phases of a
                   software life-cycle. However, code duplication
                   identification ends to produce large amounts of data
                   making the understanding of the duplication situation
                   as a whole difficult. Reengineers can easily lose sight

                   module, but whose class is defined elsewhere. Class
                   extensions offer a convenient way to incrementally
                   modify existing classes when subclassing is
                   inappropriate. Unfortunately existing approaches suffer
                   from various limitations. Either class extensions have
                   a global impact, with possibly negative effects for
                   unexpected clients, or they have a purely local impact,
                   with negative results for collaborating clients.
                   Furthermore, conflicting class extensions are either
                   disallowed, or resolved by linearization, with
                   consequent negative effects. To solve these problems we
                   present classboxes, a module system for object-oriented
                   languages that provides for method addition and
                   replacement. Moreover, the changes made by a classbox
                   are only visible to that classbox (or classboxes that
                   import it), a feature we call local rebinding. To
                   validate the model we have implemented it in the Squeak
                   Smalltalk environment, and performed benchmarks. },

                   commonly expressed through language specific
                   synchronization mechanisms in the objects'
                   implementation. Unfortunately, such an approach makes
                   it difficult to reuse these objects in applications
                   with different coordination patterns. Moreover, the
                   algorithms used for object coordination are
                   inextricably linked to the original object
                   implementation and cannot themselves be easily reused
                   for the coordination of objects with different
                   implementations. In this paper, we propose a model that
                   promotes the reuse of both objects and coordination
                   patterns. The model allows objects to synchronize their
                   execution with events occurring in other objects (e.g.
                   state changes and method invocations) in a way that is
                   compatible with local object synchronization
                   constraints and respects encapsulation. The model also
                   supports the use of class inheritance while avoiding
                   most of the problems of combining inheritance with
                   synchronization. Finally, we consider the use of the
                   model in the area of distributed multimedia
                   applications. In this area active objects encapsulate
                   media processing activities while a synchronous
                   language is used to specify their temporal
                   coordination.},

                   maintaining or extending large and complex
                   applications, with which they are unfamiliar. Typically
                   change requests and bug reports are expressed in terms
                   of system features. Much of the maintenance effort is
                   spent trying to identify which classes and methods
                   provide functionality to individual features. To tackle
                   this problem, we propose an approach based on dynamic
                   analysis that exploits the relationship between
                   features and software entities. Our definition of a
                   feature is a unit of observable behavior of a software
                   system. We apply our approach to a large open source
                   application and identify key classes and methods which
                   provide functionality to individual features.},

                   support for multiple models, incremental loading of

  abstract       = {Traits are basically mixins or interfaces but with
                   method bodies. In languages that support traits,
                   classes are composed out of traits. There are two main
                   advantages with traits. Firstly, decomposing existing
                   classes into traits from which they can be recomposed
                   improves the factoring of hierarchies. Secondly it
                   increases the library reuse potential by providing more
                   reusable traits. Identifying traits and decomposing
                   class hierarchies into traits is therefore an important
                   and challenging task to facilitate maintainability and
                   evolution. In this paper we present how we use Formal
                   Concept Analysis to identify traits in inheritance
                   hierarchies. Our approach is two-staged: first we
                   identify within a hierarchy maximal groups of methods
                   that have a set of classes in common, second we cluster
                   cohesive groups of methods based on method invocations
                   as potential traits. We applied our approach on two
                   significant hierarchies and compare our results with
                   the manual refactorization of the same code which was
                   done by the authors of traits.},

                   programming styles, and generation of more efficient
                   object code than languages where all type consistency
                   checks are performed at run time. However, even in
                   statically typed languages, there is often the need to
                   deal with data whose type cannot be determined at
                   compile time. To handle such situations safely, we
                   propose to add a type Dynamic whose values are pairs of
                   a value v and a type tag T where v has the type denoted
                   by T. Instances of Dynamic are built with an explicit
                   tagging construct and inspected with a type safe
                   typecas construct. This paper explores the syntax,
                   operational semantics, and denotational semantics of a
                   simple language including the type Dynamic.},

  abstract       = {The last decade has shown that object-oriented
                   technology alone is not enough to cope with the rapidly
                   changing requirements of present-day applications.
                   Typically, objectoriented methods do not lead to
                   designs that make a clear separation between
                   computational and compositional aspects.
                   Component-based systems, on the other hand, achieve
                   flexibility by clearly separating the stable parts of
                   systems (i.e. the components) from the specification of
                   their composition. Components are black-box entities
                   that encapsulate services behind well-defined
                   interfaces. The essential point is that components are
                   not used in isolation, but according to a software
                   architecture which determines the interfaces that
                   components may have and the rules governing their
                   composition. A component, therefore, cannot be
                   separated from a component framework. Naturally, it is
                   not enough to have components and frameworks, but one
                   needs a way to plug components together. However, one
                   of the main problems with existing languages and
                   systems is that there is no generally accepted
                   definition of how components can be composed. In this
                   thesis, we argue that the flexibility and adaptability
                   needed for component-based applications to cope with
                   changing requirements can be substantially enhanced if
                   we do not only think in terms of components, but also
                   in terms of architectures, scripts, and glue.
                   Therefore, we present a conceptual framework for
                   componentbased software development incorporating the
                   notions of components and frameworks, software
                   architectures, glue, as well as scripting and
                   coordination, which allows for an algebraic view of
                   software composition. Furthermore, we define the FORM
                   calculus, an offspring of the asynchronous Pi-calculus,
                   as a formal foundation for a composition language that
                   makes the ideas of the conceptual framework concrete.
                   The FORM calculus replaces the tuple communication of
                   the Pi-calculus by the communication of forms (or
                   extensible records). This approach overcomes the
                   problem of position-dependent arguments, since the
                   contents of communications are now independent of
                   positions and, therefore, makes it easier to define
                   flexible and extensible abstractions. We use the FORM
                   calculus to define a (meta-level) framework for
                   concurrent, objectoriented programming and show that
                   common object-oriented programming abstractions such as
                   instance variables and methods, different method
                   dispatch strategies as well as synchronization are most
                   easily modelled when class metaobjects are explicitly
                   reified as first-class entities and when a
                   compositional view of object-oriented abstractions is
                   adopted. Finally, we show that both, polymorphic form
                   extension and restriction are the basic composition
                   mechanisms for forms and illustrate that they are the
                   key concepts for defining extensible and adaptable,
                   hence reusable higher-level compositional abstractions.},

  abstract       = {Inheritance is a key concept of object-oriented
                   programming languages, features such as conceptual
                   modeling and reusability are largely accredited to it.
                   While many useful components have been, and will be,
                   developed in this paradigm, the form of white-box reuse
                   covered by inheritance has a fundamental flaw: reusing
                   components by inheritance requires an understanding of
                   the internals of the components. We can not treat
                   components of object-oriented languages as black-box
                   entities, inheritance breaks encapsulation and
                   introduces subtle dependencies between base and
                   extending classes. Component-oriented programming
                   addresses this problem by shifting away from
                   programming towards software composition. We build
                   applications by scripting components. Instead of
                   overriding the internals of a component, we focus on
                   composing its interfaces only. This form of black-box
                   reuse leads to a flexible and extendible architecture
                   with reusable components. In this master's thesis we
                   propose a migration strategy from class inheritance---a
                   whitebox form of reuse---to component composition as a
                   black-box form of reuse. We present a language
                   extension that gives us the power of inheritance
                   combined with the ease of scripting. It enables us to
                   reuse Java components using inheritance in JPiccola---a
                   small, pure and general composition language
                   implemented on the Java platform---at a high level of
                   abstraction. Using the services provided by the
                   language extension we can seamlessly generate
                   interfaces and subclasses from JPiccola. This
                   capability greatly increases the number of components
                   scriptable from JPiccola. To validate the usefulness of
                   our language extension we demonstrate how we can script
                   various Java components by de ning services and
                   compositional styles. We thus turn white-box components
                   of Java into black-box components in Piccola.},

  Title          = {An Information Mural Visualization for Duploc},
  Institution    = {University of Bern},
  Type           = {Informatikprojekt},
  abstract       = {Duploc is a tool written in Smalltalk, which is
                   currently under continuous development inside the
                   Software Composition Group at the University of Bern.
                   It is designed for representing graphically the
                   comparison results of found duplicated lines of code
                   out of a set of loaded source code files. Duploc
                   supports different programming languages (C++, C, Java,
                   Smalltalk etc.). The loaded files are compared
                   line-by-line using a simple string-match comparison
                   function--the comparison results are stored in a two
                   dimensional comparison matrix. The previous Graphical
                   User Interface (GUI) represents the obtained comparison
                   matrix as a dotplot diagram---in this two dimensional
                   grid of black painted dots, each dot stands for two
                   identical found lines of code in two different files.
                   This GUI uses a scrollbar to provide some navigation
                   facility over the comparison matrix. It is therefore
                   only suitable for visualising comparison matrixes up to
                   some hundred elements per matrix side (e.g. 800x800).
                   The project goal was to integrate into the Duploc
                   application a technique named Information Mural in
                   order to visualise a large comparison matrix. Figure 2
                   shows the Information Mural overview image of a
                   comparison matrix with 24278x24278 elements. This image
                   was produced with the new developed GUI. Each dot
                   stands for the 'match density' inside a correspondent
                   region in the underlying comparison matrix. Darker dots
                   indicates a region of the comparison matrix with more
                   matches then lighter dots. This new developed GUI is
                   typically capable to visualise a comparison matrix with
                   up to two million elements per side. It also provides
                   navigation facilities for exploring parts of the
                   comparison matrix in a dotplot like display mode.},

  abstract       = { Dynamic, unanticipated adaptation of running systems
                   is of interest in a variety of situations, ranging from
                   functional upgrades to on-the-fly debugging or
                   monitoring of critical applications. In this paper we
                   study a particular form of computational reflection,
                   called unanticipated partial behavioral reflection,
                   which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated
                   adaptation of real-world systems. Our proposal combines
                   the dynamicity of unanticipated reflection, i.e.,
                   reflection that does not require preparation of the
                   code of any sort, and the selectivity and efficiency of
                   partial behavioral reflection. First, we propose
                   unanticipated partial behavioral reflection which
                   enables the developer to precisely select the required
                   reifications, to flexibly engineer the metalevel and to
                   introduce the meta behavior dynamically. Second, we
                   present a system supporting unanticipated partial
                   behavioral reflection in Squeak Smalltalk, called
                   Geppetto, and illustrate its use with a concrete
                   example of a Seaside web application. Benchmarks
                   validate the applicability of our proposal as an
                   extension to the standard reflective abilities of
                   Smalltalk. },

                   to compose classes, while avoiding many of the problems
                   of multiple inheritance and mixin-based approaches.
                   Since most implementations of traits have focused on
                   dynamically-typed languages, the question naturally
                   arises, how can one best introduce traits to
                   statically-typed languages, like {Java} and C#? In this
                   paper we argue that the flattening property of traits
                   should be used as a guiding principle for any attempt
                   to add traits to statically-typed languages. This
                   property essentially states that, semantically, traits
                   can be compiled away. We demonstrate how this principle
                   applies to FTJ, a conservative extension to
                   Featherweight {Java}.},

                   be implemented as software programs. As analyses become
                   increasingly complex, implementing them using
                   imperative and interrogative programming is oftentimes
                   cumbersome. Consequently, the understanding, testing
                   and reuse of analyses is severely hampered. In this
                   paper we identify a set of key mechanisms that are
                   involved in the implementation of any static analysis:
                   navigation, selection, set arithmetics, filtering and
                   property aggregation. We show that neither of the
                   aforementioned approaches offers a simple support for
                   these mechanisms and, as a result, an undesirable
                   overhead of complexity is added to the implementation
                   of most analyses. The paper introduces SAIL, a language
                   designed to offer a proper support to a simplify
                   writing of analyses. In order to validate the
                   expressiveness of SAIL the paper provides a
                   comprehensive comparison with the other two approaches.},

                   architectures from object-oriented systems in the
                   context of the FAMOOS Esprit project. Our experience
                   corroborates the existence of aspects that cross-cut
                   the functionality of a software system. However, when
                   examining how the problems arising from such a
                   situation are dealt with in Ada where the language has
                   built-in support for concurrency and C++ where no such
                   support exists suggests the possibility of a more
                   general approach to aspect-oriented programming based
                   on the following hypothesis about software structure
                   that so far has proven to be correct. "A software
                   system can be structured as a set of independent
                   semantic domains consisting of a core problem domain
                   and a set of coordinated supporting domains." I will
                   use the term semantics to refer to an axiomatic or
                   denotational notions of semantics where only the result
                   is considered as semantically relevant as opposed to an
                   operational notion of semantics where how the result
                   was obtained is equally important. I will also use the
                   term coordination to mean the linking of actions or
                   instances from different semantic domains. This is a
                   very general notion of coordination of which the more
                   traditional use of coordination in relation to
                   concurrency is an example.},

                   other methods of sequence alignments, e.g. BLAST,
                   superimposing the results in one display. The advantage
                   of interaction is here that it allows exploration of
                   the dotplot, since it may be that there is no optimal
                   parameter setting which allows to find all the
                   important sequence alignments. It may be that some of
                   the alignments are only visible if there is still some
                   background noise present. In their own words: "In cases
                   like this, it is desirable to view the dot-plot under
                   many different stringency conditions and be able to
                   change them in a scrolling fashion."
                   \fullcite{Sonn95}{4. Discussion}{9} They argue in favor
                   of dotplots: * Graphical dot-matrix plots can provide
                   the most complete and detailed comparison of two
                   sequences. * Dotplots are best suited for homology
                   analysis tasks involving weak and difficult to assess
                   matches in both traditional protein or DNA comparisons
                   and in more complex situations when genomic DNA is
                   compared to proteins or DNA.},

                   environment is to compute software measurements based
                   on the underlying FAMIX model. A problem of this
                   service was that many measurements were computed but
                   could not be used in an efficient manner because they
                   were not presented to the user. The solution to this
                   problem is a tool that displays the computed
                   measurements using a graphical user interface. In this
                   project, we developed the tool MooseGager. This tool
                   displays the computed measurements of the entities of
                   the underlying model in a simple way and also offers
                   the possibility to generate charts based on these
                   measurements. These and other features of this tool
                   provide an interface to the Moose reengineering
                   environment that helps the user to use the available

                   study formal methods for component systems: embedded
                   devices. The context of embedded devices is highly
                   constrained by the physical requirements the devices
                   have to adhere to. As a result, component models for
                   embedded devices are not general purpose but geared
                   towards these constrained contexts. In this paper we
                   give the concrete setting of the Pecos project (a
                   project with as goal component engineering for embedded
                   devices). We describe the Pecos component model, and
                   show possibilities where we think formal verification
                   could be useful. We would like to use this as a very
                   concrete example to discuss formal verification

                   process of understanding the system. That is, when we
                   want to understand a certain issue of the system we ask
                   the knowledgeable developers. Yet, in large systems,
                   not every developer is knowledgeable in all the details
                   of the system. Thus, we would want to know which
                   developer is knowledgeable in the issue at hand. In
                   this paper we make use of the mapping between the
                   changes and the author identifiers (e.g., user names)
                   provided by versioning repositories. We first define a
                   measurement for the notion of code ownership. We use
                   this measurement to define the Ownership Map
                   visualization to understand when and how different
                   developers interacted in which way and in which part of
                   the system. We report the results we obtained on
                   several large systems.},

                   However, due to the heterogeneity in today's
                   object-oriented programming languages, it is hard to
                   reuse reengineering tools across legacy systems. This
                   paper proposes a language independent exchange model,
                   so that tools may perform their tasks independent of
                   the underlying programming language. Beside supporting
                   reusability between tools, we expect that this exchange
                   model will enhance the interoperability between tools
                   for metrics, visualization, reorganisation and other

                   algebra which serves as a formal basis for the query
                   language of a temporal, object-oriented data model. Our
                   algebra is a super-set of the relational algebra in
                   that it provides support for manipulating temporal
                   objects, temporal types, type hierarchies and class
                   lattices, multiple time-lines, and correction sequences
                   in addition to supporting the five relational algebra
                   operators. Graphs are used as the visual
                   representations of both the schema and the object
                   instances. The algebra provides constructs to modify
                   and manipulate the schema graph and its extension, the
                   object graph. The algebra operates on a collection or
                   collections of objects and returns a collection of
                   objects. This algebra is a first step in providing a
                   formal foundation for query processing and optimizing
                   in a temporal, object-oriented data model.},

                   abstractions. In order to rigorously specify these
                   abstractions, we are elaborating a formal object model
                   for software composition in which objects and related
                   software abstractions are viewed as patterns of
                   communicating processes. The semantic foundation is
                   Milner's pi calculus, and the starting point for our
                   object model is Pierce and Turner's encoding of objects
                   as processes in the experimental Pict programming
                   language. Our experience shows that common
                   object-oriented programming abstractions such as
                   dynamic binding, inheritance, genericity, and class
                   variables are most easily modelled when metaobjects are
                   explicitly reified as first class entities (i.e.,
                   processes). Furthermore, various roles that are
                   typically merged (or confused) in object-oriented
                   languages such as classes, implementations, and
                   metaobjects, each show up as strongly-typed, first

                   designed, pre-packaged software components using a
                   restricted set of scripting operators. Scripting
                   simplifies programming by cutting down the number of
                   the syntactic and semantic features found in a complete
                   programming language, yet is inherently open-ended in
                   that software components can be provided by a separate
                   target language. We explore scripting models in which
                   the basic components are written in an object-oriented
                   target language. We introduce a visual scripting tool
                   as a script development environment. Visual scripts
                   present components and links graphically, and a visual
                   scripting tool supports the construction of scripts
                   through the interactive editing of scripts' graphical
                   counterparts. },

                   patterns play many roles in the object-oriented

                   extend existing languages with object-oriented
                   features, and to extend object-oriented concepts and
                   languages with seemingly orthogonal features, such as
                   obc and persistence, to improve their expressive power
                   and potential as a solution to the "software crisis".
                   In many cases these integration efforts have uncovered
                   various forms of semantic interference between
                   features. We claim that the majority of these
                   difficulties are concerned with the very aspect of
                   object-orientation that we seek most urgently to
                   exploit, namely software compositionality. We shall
                   review the problems of integrating obc and
                   object-oriented features from this viewpoint and
                   discuss some of the more important requirements to be
                   met. Finally, we propose a view of objects as patterns
                   of communicating agents that suggests the development
                   of a class of concurrent object-oriented languages
                   parameterized by patterns that address the needs of

                   software system and thus are valuable sources of
                   information for a reverse engineer. When analyzing the
                   evolution of a system, we need to know how and which
                   features were modified to recover both the change
                   intention and its extent, namely which source artifacts
                   are affected. Typically, the implementation of a
                   feature crosscuts a number of source artifacts. To
                   obtain a mapping between features to the source
                   artifacts, we exercise the features and capture their
                   execution traces. However this results in large traces
                   that are difficult to interpret. To tackle this issue
                   we compact the traces into simple sets of source
                   artifacts that participate in a feature's runtime
                   behavior. We refer to these compacted traces as feature
                   views. Within a feature view, we partition the source
                   artifacts into disjoint sets of characterized software
                   entities. The characterization defines the level of
                   participation of a source entity in the features. We
                   then analyze the features over several versions of a
                   system and we plot their evolution to reveal how and
                   hich features were affected by changes in the code. We
                   show the usefulness of our approach by applying it to a
                   case study where we address the problem of merging
                   parallel development tracks of the same system.},

                   well-accepted techniques to understand deep internals
                   about a program. However in many cases navigating the
                   stack trace is not enough to find bugs, since the cause
                   of a bug is often not in the stack trace anymore and
                   old state is lost, so out of reach from the debugger.
                   In this paper, we present the design and implementation
                   of a backward-in-time debugger for a dynamic language,
                   i.e, a debugger that allows one to navigate back the
                   history of the application. We present the design and
                   implementation of a backward-in-time debugger called
                   Unstuck and show our solution to key implementation

                   of multi-object coordination. In our language,
                   coordination patterns can be specified abstractly,
                   independent of the protocols needed to implement them.
                   Coordination patterns are expressed in the form of
                   constraints that restrict invocation of a group of
                   objects. Constraints are defined in terms of the
                   interface of the objects being invoked rather than
                   their internal representation. Invocation constraints
                   enforce properties, such as temporal ordering and
                   atomicity, that hold when invoking objects in a group.
                   A constraint can permanently control access to a group
                   of objects, thereby expressing an inherent access
                   restriction associated with the group. Furthermore, a
                   constraint can temporarily enforce access restrictions
                   during the activity of individual clients. In that way,
                   constraints can express specialized access schemes
                   required by a group of clients.},

  abstract       = {This paper describes three message-based approaches to
                   choreography in computer animation. These approaches
                   may be placed in the following categories, scripted
                   choreography, choreography driven by cost functions,
                   and choreography produced by interactions of autonomous
                   entities. The main concept that all of these forms of
                   choreography share is that they all rely upon the
                   message passing facilities of an object-oriented
                   computer animation system, The Clockworks. There are
                   numerous benefits derived from the message-based
                   approach to computer animation choreography. These
                   include modularity, unrestricted modification of
                   parameters, interactive alteration of messages, access
                   to modeling and graphics tools, and a versatile
                   interpretive language.},

                   range of application domains (e.g. CASE, systems
                   design, outline processors etc.). However, in order to
                   function effectively in these domains, hypertext
                   systems must support versioning. In this paper we will
                   examine the issues involved in providing versioning
                   facilities that not only support but enhance the
                   special features provided by hypertext. We analyse the
                   requirements that should be satisfied by a versioning
                   system and we examine how existing hypertext systems
                   cope with these requirements. We then describe a set of
                   mechanisms that are powerful enough to comply with our
                   requirements. Finally, we present a demonstration
                   system that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness
                   of our versioning mechanisms.},

                   too abstract description of conflicting activities.
                   Hence, we propose to replace it with a unary conflict
                   operator and a conflict restriction operator, yielding
                   the process algebra DiX. We show that DiX is a semantic
                   extension of CCS. Moreover, DiX is equipped with a
                   simple distributed semantics defined in terms of nets
                   with inhibitor arcs, where the set of transitions is
                   generated by three axiom schemata only. This net
                   semantics is the main motivation for the present

                   for about 4 years. They have evolved considerably and
                   are now slowly converging to common and accepted
                   overall architecture. The goal of this paper is to
                   describe this architecture. An object database system
                   supports an object database model. This model can be
                   decomposed into four different aspects: data, behavior,
                   persistence and naming. An object database system
                   consists of a database engine supporting all or part of
                   the database model. On top of this engine are
                   implemented a number of language interfaces: an object
                   definition language, an object query language and one
                   or several programming languages. These programming
                   languages can be internal or external. Internal
                   languages are fully managed within the system, and are
                   in general proprietary extensions of existing
                   programming languages (C, Smalltalk, Lisp or C++).
                   External languages are managed outside of the database
                   system and are in most case standard languages (C++ or
                   Smalltalk).},

                   in the FAMOOS project have learned this lesson the hard
                   way: they are now faced with large and rigid software

  Type           = {Diploma thesis},
  abstract       = {To keep up with rapidly changing requirements
                   applications are increasingly built out of software
                   components. A new trend is now to give those software
                   components control over their own actions, to turn them
                   into concurrently running software agents. These
                   software agents have to be relatively independent to
                   keep them exchangeable. Although independent, they
                   still need to interact in order to achieve the
                   application's overall goal. This results in the need to
                   coordinate their interactions. A number of coordination
                   models were created to express common coordination
                   solutions. Linda is one of the most prominent
                   representatives of such coordination models. Linda is
                   widely used because it offers simple means to separate
                   coordination code from computational code within a
                   single agent. Linda also offers a high degree of
                   decoupling of agents through its generative
                   communication style. However, Linda offers no direct
                   support for the concentration of the coordination
                   aspects of a whole application in a single location.
                   Furthermore, Linda only offers a set of primitive
                   operations and leaves the user with the task to
                   construct realistic coordination abstractions out of
                   them. Coordination abstractions are often hard-coded
                   into the participant agents' protocols and therefore
                   neither flexible nor reusable. They are typically
                   spread all over the application and it is almost
                   impossible to identify them. It is not easy to
                   encapsulate coordination abstractions because
                   coordination typically affects multiple agents, and in
                   open systems other requirements, such as flexibility
                   and security, must also be dealt with. We propose an
                   open, flexible and extensible architecture for explicit
                   coordination abstractions in open systems, called
                   APROCO. Our solution is based on the insight that
                   separation of concerns (coordination and computation)
                   is a necessary precondition for building reusable
                   parts. The client agents of APROCO communicate through
                   shared data spaces known from Linda using its
                   generative communication style. The coordination
                   between the participating agents is managed through
                   special coordination agents that implement the used
                   coordination abstractions. We present a list of
                   coordination abstractions in open systems and show the
                   applicability of the approach with some examples.},

  abstract       = { Object-oriented applications are difficult to extend
                   and maintain, due to the presence of implicit
                   dependencies in the inheritance hierarchy. Although
                   these dependencies often correspond to well-known
                   schemas, such as hook and template methods, new
                   unanticipated dependency schemas occur in practice, and
                   can consequently be hard to recognize and detect. To
                   tackle this problem, we have applied Concept Analysis
                   to automatically detect recurring dependency schemas in
                   class hierarchies used in object-oriented applications.
                   In this paper we describe our mapping of OO
                   dependencies to the formal framework of Concept
                   Analysis, we apply our approach to a non-trivial case
                   study, and we report on the kinds of dependencies that
                   are uncovered with this technique. As a result, we show
                   how the discovered dependency schemas correspond not
                   only to good design practices, but also to bad smells
                   in design. },

  Title          = {Positive Subtyping},
  BookTitle      = {Proceedings POPL '95},
  abstract       = {The statement S<T in a lambda-calculus with subtyping
                   is traditionally interpreted as a semantic coercion
                   function of type [[S]]->[[T]] that extracts the ``T
                   part'' of an element of S. If the subtyping relation is
                   restricted to covariant positions, this interpretation
                   may be enriched to include both the coercion and an
                   overwriting function put[S,T]: [[S]]->[[T]]->[[S]] that
                   updates the T part of an element of S. We give a
                   realizability model and a sound equational theory.
                   Though weaker than familiar calculi of bounded
                   quantification, the restricted system retains
                   sufficient power to model objects, encapsulation, and
                   message passing. Moreover, inheritance may be
                   implemented very straightforwardly in this setting,
                   using the put functions arising from ordinary subtyping
                   of records in place of the more sophisticated systems
                   of record extension and update often used for this
                   purpose. The equational laws relating the behavior of
                   coercions and put functions can be used to prove simple
                   properties of the resulting classes in such a way that
                   proofs for superclasses are ``inherited'' by
                   subclasses.},

  Title          = {Effective Clone Detection Without Language Barriers},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {Duplication is detected by comparing features of
                   source fragments. The main problem for the detection is
                   that source code is rarely copied exactly. The
                   detection process must be able to ignore the
                   superficial differences and to concentrate on
                   fundamental similarities in order to find relevant
                   duplication. While the high level information yielded
                   by syntactic and semantic code analysis can be put to
                   effective use, the drawbacks of these deep analysis
                   techniques are most importantly the reduced
                   adaptability to different programming languages.
                   Because duplication is an ubiquitous problem, however,
                   support for duplication detection and management is
                   needed for every programming language in use. In this
                   thesis we investigate how the premises of simplicity
                   and adaptability influence all phases of the clone
                   detection process. We analyze how line-based string
                   matching as basic feature comparison technique can be
                   augmented by minimal parsing to improve detection
                   sensitivity. We investigate which code normalization
                   techniques remove the superficial differences and
                   reveal the similarities. We show how clone candidates
                   are retrieved from the results of the basic comparison.
                   We propose measures to select the relevant clones from
                   the set of all retrieved candidates. We finally develop
                   a collection of quantitative visualizations that enable
                   the assessment of the copied code in the context of the
                   entire system. We experimentally validate the proposed
                   code normalization technique in terms of precision and
                   recall, show how the proposed relevancy measures
                   improve on simple size metrics, and discuss scalability
                   issues. We also validate the line-based granularity,
                   and perform a comparison of our technique with related
                   string matching detectors.},

                   fundamental as-pect of object-oriented concurrent
                   programming, there is only little support for its
                   specification and abstraction at the language level.
                   This is a problem because coordination is often buried
                   in the code of the coordinated objects, leading to a
                   lack of abstraction and reuse. Here we present CoLaS, a
                   coordination model and its implementation based on the
                   notion of Coordination Groups. By clearly identifying
                   and separating the coordination from the co-ordinated
                   objects CoLaS provides a better abstraction and reuse
                   of the coordination and the coordinated objects.
                   Moreover CoLaS's high dynamicity provides better
                   support for coordination of active objects.},

                   Concept Analysis to analyse how classes in an
                   object-oriented inheritance hierarchy are coupled by
                   means of the inheritance and interfaces relationships.
                   To perform our analysis, we use the information
                   provided by the self-send and super-send behaviour of
                   each class in the hierarchy. Especially for large and
                   complex inheritance hierarchies, we believe that this
                   analysis can help in understanding the software, in
                   particular with how reuse is achieved. Additionally,
                   the proposed technique allows us to identify weak spots
                   in the inheritance hierarchy that may be improved, and
                   to serve as guidelines for extending or customising an
                   object-oriented application framework. As a first step,

  Title          = {Modeling Object-Oriented Software for Reverse
                   Engineering and Refactoring},
  School         = {University of Berne},
  abstract       = {The increased popularity of the object-oriented
                   paradigm has also increased the interest in
                   object-oriented reengineering. First of all,
                   object-oriented software systems suffer from similar
                   maintainability problems as traditional procedural
                   systems, displaying the need for reengineering
                   techniques tailored to deal with object- oriented code.
                   Secondly, the increased importance of iterative
                   development processes make reengineering techniques
                   valuable in forward engineering, and thus for all
                   paradigms that software is developed in. Reengineering
                   requires tool support to deal with the large amounts of
                   information and the wide variety of tasks to be
                   performed. An important consideration in building tool
                   environments for reengineering is what information must
                   be provided and how this information is modelled.
                   Design choices have a considerable impact not only on
                   the ability to support reengineering tasks, but also on
                   issues such as scalability and tool interoperability.
                   Several metamodels exist that model software for the
                   purposes of reengineering. However, they generally lack
                   a discussion of the relevance of information for
                   reengineering and the trade-offs of modeling
                   alternatives. This thesis presents FAMIX, a
                   language-independent metamodel for modelling
                   object-oriented software for reengineering purposes.We
                   discuss the exact contents of the metamodel, including
                   its relevance for reengineering and how the metamodel
                   supports the different object-oriented languages
                   through its language- independent core. We also discuss
                   the infrastructural design decisions of FAMIX by
                   placing it into a design space for infrastructural
                   aspects of reengineering repositories and metamodels.
                   The design space presents multiple interdependent
                   aspects, their design alternatives and howthese impact
                   issues such as scalability, extensibility and
                   information exchange. We validate the ability of
                   FAMIXto support reengineering on a language-independent
                   level in twoways. First, we present Moose, a
                   reengineering tool environment with a repository based
                   on FAMIX. Moose serves as a foundation for multiple
                   reengineering tools and has been applied to reverse
                   engineer several large industrial case studies.
                   Secondly,we define a set of fifteen low-level
                   refactorings in terms of the information available in
                   FAMIX. Refactoring requires sufficient, complete and
                   100% correct information as well as a clear
                   interpretation of the supported languages in the
                   language-independent core of the metamodel, in order to
                   correctly perform transformations on the
                   language-specific code level. As such the refactorings
                   provide an in-depth validation of the language
                   independence of FAMIX.},

                   engineering. In this paper, we describe how
                   object-oriented technology can be applied to provide a
                   class of abstractions, called coordination
                   abstractions, that can simplify the construction of
                   parallel software. Coordination abstractions capture
                   communication, synchronization and topological
                   information about parallel computations. Abstractions
                   can be defined that provide support for a surprisingly
                   broad range of parallel applications which share a
                   common underlying coordination structure. We
                   demonstrate this by describing the design and
                   implementation of a coordination abstraction in {Java}
                   and its application to the solution of selected

  abstract       = {It is an increasingly accepted fact that software
                   development is a non-linear activity with inherently
                   feedback driven processes. In such a development
                   environment, however, it is important that major
                   structural changes in the design and/or architecture of
                   a software system under development are introduced with
                   care and documented accordingly. In order to give
                   developers appropriate tools that can identify such
                   changes, we need to have a good understanding how
                   software systems evolve over time so that evolutionary
                   anomalies can be automatically detected. In this paper,
                   we present recurring high-level structural and
                   evolutionary patterns that we have observed in a number
                   of public-domain object-oriented software systems and
                   define a simple predictive model that can aid
                   developers in detecting structural changes and, as a
                   consequence, improve the underlying development
                   processes.},

                   not support reuse and configurability in an effective
                   way. This problem can be addressed by augmenting OO
                   analysis and design with feature modeling and by
                   applying generative implementation techniques. Feature
                   modeling allows capturing the variability of domain
                   concepts. Concrete concept instances can then be
                   synthesized from abstract specifications. Using a
                   simple example of a configurable list component, we
                   demonstrate the application of feature modeling and how
                   to implement a feature model as a generator. We
                   introduce the concepts of configuration repositories
                   and configuration generators and show how to implement
                   them using object-oriented, generic, and generative
                   language mechanisms. The configuration generator
                   utilizes C++ template metaprogramming, which enables
                   its execution at compile-time.},

  abstract       = {Testing the behavior of object-oriented systems is an
                   important activity in the software development and
                   maintenance process. It validates an expected behavior
                   against an observed behavior. A behavioral test is an
                   assertion over a set of messages and objects states
                   that occur during the execution of a system. Testing
                   behavior is especially important for object-oriented
                   legacy systems where current behavior is the only thing
                   we can trust because a specification is often missing.
                   There are two problems with testing behavior of
                   object-oriented systems. First there exists no common
                   form to express a hypothesis about an expected behavior
                   and to validate it against an actual program behavior.
                   This has the consequence that behavioral tests are
                   carried out manually by stepping through an execution
                   with a debugger and asserting behavioral properties by
                   visually inspecting states, arguments and messages in
                   the context of the execution history of the system.
                   Second it is a priori not clear what kind of behavior
                   should be tested and how it is represented in terms of
                   message passing and state changes. This causes
                   additional friction when setting up tests for behaviors
                   that occur over and over again in different systems. In
                   this thesis the concept of trace-based object-oriented
                   testing is introduced. It supports the specification of
                   an expected behavior in the form of a formal expression
                   and an automatic test of whether an expected behavior
                   occurs in previously recorded execution trace. A
                   prototype tool TESTLOG on the basis of the logic
                   language SOUL is developed that supports trace-based
                   object-oriented testing in the form of a logic query
                   over a trace. As a validation of the concept behavioral
                   tests for different types of behaviors that frequently
                   occur in object-oriented systems are designed and
                   documented in the form of a pattern language. The use
                   of the computational power of a logic language for
                   behavioral testing solves the problem of automatically
                   identifying if an expected behavior occurs in an
                   execution trace. A set of predefined logic rules serves
                   as a language to compose complex behavioral tests such
                   that a tester can take advantage of the intrinsic rule
                   abstraction facility of SOUL. In order to identify
                   recurring behavioral concepts we classify behavior and
                   try to abstract general purpose templates for different
                   types of behavior in order to obtain reusable
                   behavioral test artifacts.},

                   the primary abstractions from which applications are
                   built, while methods contain the actual program logic.
                   The main problem of this task is to quickly grasp the
                   purpose and inner structure of a class. To achieve this
                   goal, one must be able to overview multiple methods at

                   or they will die. Although object-oriented software
                   systems are built to last, over time they degrade as
                   much as any legacy software system. As a consequence,
                   one must invest in reengineering efforts to keep
                   further development costs down. Even though software
                   systems and their business contexts may differ in
                   countless ways, the techniques one uses to understand,
                   analyze and transform these systems tend to be very
                   similar. As a consequence, one may identify various
                   reengineering patterns that capture best practice in
                   reverse- and re-engineering object-oriented legacy
                   systems. We present a brief outline of a large

                   several years of experience with object-oriented legacy

                   Development Method (VDM) so called OOVDM, additionally

                   Our research contributes to the extension of VDM by an
                   Object-Oriented concept which supports incremental and
                   subtyping inheritance. OOVDM has two types of modules,
                   which are class modules and type modules. Class modules
                   define objects having their internal states. Their
                   states can be changed states, i.e. values, and denote
                   the domains of the values. OOVDM has two kinds of
                   inheritance mechanisms---incremental inheritance and
                   subtyping inheritance. Both concepts are useful for
                   overloading existing descriptions and for hierarchical

                   technology alone is not enough to guarantee that the

                   ``well-designed'' object-oriented software may be

                   We propose a conceptual framework that will help yield
                   more flexible object-oriented systems by encouraging
                   explicit separation of computational and compositional
                   elements. We distinguish between components that adhere
                   to an architectural style, scripts that specify
                   compositions, and glue that may be needed to adapt
                   components' interfaces and contracts. We also discuss a
                   prototype of an experimental composition language

                   to compose classes, while avoiding many of the problems
                   of multiple inheritance and mixin-based approaches.
                   Since most implementations of traits have focused on
                   dynamically-typed languages, the question naturally
                   arises, how can one best introduce traits to
                   statically-typed languages, like {Java} and C#? In this
                   paper we argue that the flattening property of traits
                   should be used as a guiding principle for any attempt
                   to add traits to statically-typed languages. This
                   property essentially states that, semantically, traits
                   can be compiled away. We demonstrate how this principle
                   applies to FTJ, a conservative extension to
                   Featherweight {Java}.},

                   combined with the rapid evolution of underlying
                   platforms demands for a plug-in component architecture.
                   Nevertheless, code for controlling distributed
                   activities is usually spread over multiple subsystems,
                   which makes it hard to dynamically reconfigure

                   coordination components as a way to encapsulate the
                   coordination of a distributed system into a separate,
                   pluggable entity. In an object-oriented context we
                   introduce two design guidelines (namely, "turn
                   contracts into objects" and "turn configuration into a
                   factory object") that help developers to separate
                   coordination from computation and to develop reusable
                   and flexible solutions for coordination in distributed

  abstract       = { A single software fault may cause several tests to
                   break, if they cover the same methods. The coverage
                   sets of tests may not just overlap, but include one
                   another. This information could be of great use to
                   developers who would like to focus on the most specific
                   test that concerns a given fault. Unfortunately,
                   existing unit testing tools neither gather nor exploit
                   this information. We have developed a simple approach
                   that analyses a set of test suites, and infers the
                   partial order corresponding to inclusion hierarchy of
                   the coverage sets. When several tests in an inclusion
                   chain break, we can guide the developer to the most
                   specific test in the chain. Our first experiments with
                   three case studies suggest that most unit tests for
                   typical applications are, in fact, comparable to other
                   tests, and can therefore be partially ordered.
                   Furthermore, we show that this partial order is
                   semantically meaningful, since faults that cause a test
                   to break will, in nearly all cases cause less specific
                   tests too break too. },

                   of software engineering. This paper describes a course
                   on software engineering with objects which tracks the
                   evolution of this discipline. We work through the

                   design methods evolved over time, culminating in

                   important in the domain of local area networks (LAN)
                   and wide area networks (WAN). Different kinds of mobile
                   entities are a rapidly evolving area of research in the
                   field of World-Wide-Web, distributed and open systems.
                   The first part of this thesis surveys different
                   approaches in order to develop open, flexible and
                   distributed systems. We focus on an approach of
                   stateless mobile software entities. The second part of
                   this thesis introduces the notion "fruitlet" and
                   "run-time framework" and classifies "fruitlet" within
                   other existing mobility meanings and compares them with
                   other concepts related to mobile code. We describe a
                   prototype of a basic software architecture for
                   stateless mobile software entities. The third part
                   shows examples of open, flexible and extendable
                   software applications using the described technology of
                   "fruitlets".},

  abstract       = {It is a generally accepted fact that software systems
                   are constructed and gradually refined over a period of
                   time. During this time, code is written and modified
                   until stable releases of the system emerge. Many
                   researchers have studied systems over a longer period
                   of time in order to understand how they change and
                   evolve. Despite these efforts, we still lack a precise
                   understanding how various properties of software change
                   over time, in particular in the area of object-oriented
                   systems. Such an understanding is of great importance
                   if we want to come up with techniques to provide
                   feedback on the evolution of quality and predictions
                   about further evolution of software systems.
                   Historically, collection of sufficient data to build
                   useful models was not practical as source code and
                   build histories were not freely available. It is our
                   opinion that by focusing our attention towards Open
                   source software repositories, we have a better hope
                   building predictive models to help developers and
                   managers. In this paper, we will report on our
                   exploratory study analyzing Open source object oriented
                   software projects and present a first predictive model
                   based on this analysis},

                   hyperimages, represent a variation of the conventional
                   digital images which implies pixels of different
                   dimensions within the same image. The extent of a
                   hyperimage is the disjoint union of all pixel extents
                   it contains, which are relatively open unit cubes with
                   respect to the euclidean topology of the underlying
                   space. This approach is independent of any specific
                   dimension of image and space, respectively, and allows
                   strict partitioning of images into subimages, not just
                   subdividing. Since the storage required by a
                   $d$-dimensional hyperimage of resolution $n^d$ is
                   $\approx 2^{d}n^{d}$ when using a binary matrix
                   representation, a more space efficient bintree
                   representation is investigated. Algorithms for the
                   Boolean operations, the computation of elementary
                   topological properties and the computation of some
                   important measures of $d$-dimensional hyperimages
                   (volume, surface, Euler characteristic) are presented.
                   Because of the nature of bintrees, the implementation
                   of these algorithms, too, can be performed

                   which aspects may then be applied. Refinements and

                   demonstrated that programmers can encapsulate a
                   reusable, tailorable software architecture as a
                   collection of collaborating, extensible object classes.
                   Such frameworks are particularly important for
                   developing open systems in which not only functionality
                   but architecture is reused across a family of related
                   applications. Unfortunately, the design of frameworks
                   remains an art rather than a science, because of the
                   inherent conflict between reuse --- packaging software
                   components that can be reused in as many contexts as
                   possible --- and tailorability --- designing software
                   architectures easily adapted to target requirements. },

                   einer speziellen Art und Weise konstruiert werden

                   Applikation zusammengef\"{u}gt werden zu k\"{o}nnen.
                   Mit anderen Worten, eine Softwarekomponente ist Teil
                   eines Komponentenframeworks, da{\ss} (i) eine
                   Bibliothek von Black-Box-Komponenten zu Verf\"{u}gung

                   provide methodologies for the reengineering of large

                   Moose Reengineering Environment, based on the language

                   object-oriented programming languages has mostly
                   focussed on applying or extending functional type
                   theory to functional "objects." This approach, while
                   benefitting from a vast body of existing literature,
                   has the disadvantage of dealing with state change
                   either in a roundabout way or not at all, and
                   completely side-stepping issues of concurrency. In
                   particular, dynamic issues of non-uniform service
                   availability and conformance to protocols are not
                   addressed by functional types. We propose a new type
                   framework that characterizes objects as regular (finite
                   state) processes that provide guarantees of service
                   along public channels. We also propose an original
                   notion of subtyping for regular types that extends
                   Wegner and Zdonik's "principle of substitutability" to
                   non-uniform service availability, and we relate it to
                   known process equivalences. Finally, we formalize what
                   it means to "satisfy a client's expectations," and we
                   show how regular types can be used to tell when
                   sequential or concurrent clients are satisfied. [NB: a

                   detail for each metaclass is needed and present our
                   architecture for making this specification. We also
                   illustrate a powerful use of this technique with a
                   scripting extension to our application framework. With
                   an evaluation of our current MetaFlex implementation
                   and its use with the scripting extension, we conclude
                   that this service is best provided by compiler vendors.},

  abstract       = {The peer review process for technical contributions to
                   conferences in computing sciences is very thorough, and
                   can be as stringent as the review process for journal
                   publications in other domains. The programme committee
                   for such a conference will typically convene at a
                   meeting, where submitted papers are discussed, and
                   accepted or rejected for presentation at the
                   conference. Experience shows that discussions are more
                   focussed, and the entire process runs more smoothly if
                   most of the time is devoted to those papers that are
                   actually "championed" by some committee member. In
                   order to make this work effectively, however, the
                   notion of "championing" must be introduced early in the
                   review process. This paper presents a set of process
                   patterns that help to achieve this goal.},

                   Logic Programming Language},
  BookTitle      = {ECOOP 2001 International Workshop on MultiParadigm
                   Programming with Object-Oriented Languages},
  abstract       = {Meta-programming is the act of using one system or
                   language to reason about another one. Reflection
                   describes systems that have access to and change a
                   causally connected representation of themselves, hence
                   leading to self-extensible systems . Up to now, most of
                   the reflective languages have been implemented in the
                   same paradigm. In this paper, we propose
                   \emph{symbiotic reflection} as a way to integrate a
                   meta programming language with the object-oriented
                   language it reasons about and is implemented in. New to
                   this approach is that any element of the implementation
                   language can be reasoned about and acted upon (not only
                   the self representation), and that both languages are
                   of different paradigms. Moreover, every language
                   implementer that is faced with the problem of allowing
                   the base language to access the underlying
                   meta-language has to solve the problem of enabling
                   entity transfer between both worlds. We propose a
                   uniform schema, called upping/downing, to this problem
                   that avoid explicit wrapping or typechecking. We
                   illustrate this with SOUL (the Smalltalk Open
                   Unification Language), a logic programming language in
                   symbiotic reflection with the object-oriented language
                   Smalltalk. We show how SOUL does logic reasoning
                   directly on Smalltalk objects, and how to use this to
                   implement type snooping},

                   local time. It allows to describe and analyze both
                   locally temporal and behavioral properties of
                   distributed objects and interactions among them. We
                   introduce timed bisimulations with respect to local
                   time. These bisimulations equate distributed objects if
                   and only if their behaviors are completely matched and
                   their timings are within a given bound. The
                   bisimulations provide a method to verify distributed
                   objects with temporal uncertainties and real-time
                   objects with non-strict time constraints.},

  abstract       = {Several advanced applications, such as those dealing
                   with the Web, need to handle data whose structure is
                   not known a-priori. Such requirement severely limits
                   the applicability of traditional database techniques,
                   that are based on the fact that the structure of data
                   (e.g. the database schema) is known before data are
                   entered into the database. Moreover, in traditional
                   database systems, whenever a data item (e.g. a tuple,
                   an object, and so on) is entered, the application
                   specifies the collection (e.g. relation, class, and so
                   on) the data item belongs to. Collections are the basis
                   for handling queries and indexing and therefore a
                   proper classification of data items in collections is
                   crucial. In this paper, we address this issue in the
                   context of an extended object-oriented data model. We
                   propose an approach to classify objects, created
                   without specifying the class they belong to, in the
                   most appropriate class of the schema, that is, the
                   class closest to the object state. In particular, we
                   introduce the notion of weak membership of an object in
                   a class, and define two measures, the conformity and
                   the heterogeneity degrees, exploited by our
                   classification algorithm to identify the most
                   appropriate class in which an object can be classified,
                   among the ones of which it is a weak member.},

                   useful. Change appears in several forms and needs to be
                   accommodated at different levels. We propose
                   ChangeBoxes as a mechanism to encapsulate, manage,
                   analyze and exploit changes to software systems. Our
                   thesis is that only by making change explicit and
                   manipulable can we enable the software developer to
                   manage software change more effectively than is
                   currently possible. Furthermore we argue that we need
                   new insights into assessing the impact of changes and
                   we need to provide new tools and techniques to manage
                   them. We report on the results of some initial
                   prototyping efforts, and we outline a series of
                   research activities that we have started to explore the

                   hiding differences between network resources, along
                   with a method of managing them in a consistent way.
                   Frequently, network management tools are based on
                   proprietary products and are often complex both to use
                   and to install. The increasing popularity of the World
                   Wide Web, with its established user interface and the
                   ability to run on almost any platform, offers a new way
                   to provide wide access to complex software
                   applications. This paper describes the architecture and
                   implementation of two new network management
                   applications that are accessible through the web and
                   are targeted to run on powerful hosts as well as small
                   mobile computers. The GDMO/ASN.1 Search Engine enables
                   users to perform complex queries and to navigate OSI
                   management documents exploiting the web hypertext
                   facilities. Liaison is a web-based browser for
                   CMIP/SNMP agents equipped with powerful tools such as a
                   directory service and a metadata facility.},

                   factor for embedded devices. Already today, software
                   accounts for more than 50 percent of the development
                   costs of such a device. However, software development
                   practices in this area lag far behind those in the
                   traditional software industry. Reuse is hardly ever
                   heard of in some areas, development from scratch is
                   common practice and component-based software is usually
                   a foreign word. PECOS is a collaborative project
                   between industrial and research partners that seeks to
                   enable component-based technology for a certain class
                   of embedded systems known as "field devices" by taking
                   into account the specific properties of this
                   application area. In this paper we introduce a
                   component model for field device software. Furthermore
                   we report on the PECOS component composition language

                   written in LO manifest two levels of granularity, each
                   with their specific communication paradigm. At the
                   finer level, individual objects are composed into
                   agents and communicate through blackboards. At the
                   coarser level, these agents interact through
                   broadcasts. This dichotomy determines implementation
                   choices: Concurrency among agents naturally maps onto
                   distributed processes (with e.g. RPC), whereas
                   concurrency among objects maps onto threads (in shared
                   memory). These four abstractions (objects, blackboards,
                   agents, and broadcasts) together with LO 's basic
                   computation paradigm (rules) are implemented as a
                   class-based run-time library, thereby enriching
                   classical object-oriented platforms. Finally we stress
                   the fact that the resulting run-time library is poly-
                   morphic: The run-time can manipulate any independently
                   defined appli- cation object, provided its class
                   respects a minimal protocol. Run-time polymorphism has
                   turned out to be the key to composition-based reuse.},

  abstract       = {GARF is an object-oriented programming environment
                   aimed to support the design of reliable distributed
                   applications. Its computational model is based on two
                   programming levels: the functional level and the
                   behavioral level. At the functional level, software
                   functionalities are described using passive objects,
                   named data objects, in a centralized, volatile, and
                   failure free environment. At the behavioral level, data
                   objects are dynamically bound to encapsulators and
                   mailers which support distribution, concurrency,
                   persistence and fault tolerance. Encapsulators wrap
                   data objects by controlling how the latter send and
                   receive messages, while mailers perform communications
                   between encapsulators. This paper describes how the
                   GARF computational model enables to build flexible and
                   highly modular abstractions for the design of reliable
                   distributed applications.},

                   concept of constraints to express rules of the problem
                   domain in the specification model, restricting the
                   possible instances of the model. As such, constraints
                   describe properties that must be true at each moment in
                   time for the entire system , without determining how
                   they are to be preserved. The ways in which these
                   constraints are introduced in the model differ from
                   method to method, and even between distinct constraint
                   types in a single method. Different ways in which
                   constraints can be described, are illustrated and
                   compared. Specifying constraints as informal
                   annotations or by operational restrictions is too
                   informal and low level for analysis. According to the
                   properties, importance and influence of the constraint
                   types on the object model, they ought to be described
                   differently. Some constraints, such as connectivity
                   constraints, definition and as a reminder for these
                   kind of constraints Others, such as attribute value
                   constraints, are best introduced as independent items
                   part of a separate concept grafted on a general model
                   to get a consistent, unambiguous, symmetrical and
                   general applicable constraint description. Yet others,
                   such as relational and existential dependency
                   constraints, should be expressed implicitly by a
                   hierarchical model structure. This approach enriches
                   the object model in such a way that it highlights the
                   logical structure of the problem domain to its right
                   extent.},

                   the test code should evolve simultaneously with the

                   possibilities of using dynamic analysis to extract test
                   dependencies. Then we investigate whether heuristic
                   metrics on these dynamic test dependencies provide a
                   measure for the degree to which the test code evolves
                   with the product code. As a case study we use Apache
                   Ant and look specifically at two different phases in
                   the history of this open source project. We conclude
                   that dynamic test dependencies alone do not suffice to
                   provide such a measure and we propose an alternative

                   the fundamental reuse mechanism in object-oriented
                   programming languages, the main variants --- single
                   inheritance, multiple inheritance, and mixin
                   inheritance --- all suffer from conceptual and
                   practical problems. In the first part of this paper, we
                   identify and illustrate these problems. We then present
                   traits, a simple compositional model for structuring
                   object-oriented programs. A trait is essentially a
                   group of pure methods that serves as a building block
                   for classes and is a primitive unit of code reuse. In
                   this model, classes are composed from a set of traits
                   by specifying glue code that connects the traits
                   together and accesses the necessary state. We
                   demonstrate how traits overcome the problems arising
                   from the different variants of inheritance, we discuss
                   how traits can be implemented effectively, and we
                   summarize our experience applying traits to refactor an

                   methods and it supports atomic transactions. The result
                   is a system that allows applications to share objects
                   safely across both space and time. The paper describes
                   how the THOR implementation is able to support this
                   pow-erful model and yet achieve good performance, even

                   need to manage very large numbers of very small
                   objects. In addition, the paper puts the performance of
                   THOR in perspective by showing that it substantially
                   outperforms a system based on memory mapped files, even
                   though that system provides much less functionality
                   than THOR.},

  Title          = {Assessing Test Quality --- TestLint},
  School         = {University Bern},
  abstract       = {With the success of agile methodologies, Testing has
                   become a common and important activity in the
                   development of software projects. Large and auto- mated
                   test-suites ensure that the system is behaving as
                   expected. Moreover, tests also offer a live
                   documentation for the code and can be used to under-
                   stand foreign code. However, as the system evolves,
                   tests need to evolve as well to keep up with the
                   system, and as the test suite grows larger, the effort
                   invested into maintaining tests becomes a significant
                   activity. In this context, the quality of tests becomes
                   an important issue, as developers need to assess and
                   understand the tests they have to maintain. While
                   testing have grown to be popular and well supported by
                   today's IDEs, methodologies and tools trying to assess
                   the quality of tests are still poorly or not at all
                   integrated into the testing process. Most important,
                   there has been no attempts yet to concretely measure
                   the quality of a test by detecting design flaws of the
                   test code, so called Test Smells. We contribute to the
                   research of testing methodologies by measuring and
                   assessing the quality of tests. In particular we
                   analyze Test Smells and define a set of criteria to
                   determine test quality. We evaluate our results in a
                   large case-study and present TestLint, an approach to
                   automatically detect Test Smells. We provide a bundle
                   of tools that tightly integrate source-code
                   development, automated testing and quality assessment
                   of tests. },

                   describe a design space that characterizes approaches
                   to object-oriented obc in terms of a number of language
                   design choices concerning the relationship between
                   objects and obc. We identify requirements for software
                   reuse and, with the help of an example that illustrates
                   several of these requirements, explore the design space
                   in order to evaluate which design choices interfere
                   with reuse and which appear to adequately support it.

                   OMG on the Meta Object Faci lity (MOF) being the most
                   noteworthy example. We welcome these standardisation
                   efforts, yet warn against the tendency to use UML as
                   the panacea for all exchange standards. In particular,

                   tool-interoperability standard for integrating
                   round-trip engineering tools, because one is forced to
                   rely on UML's built-in extension mechanisms to a
                   dequately model the reality in source-code. Meanwhile,

                   suggestions that we ho pe will influence future

                   algorithms. We develop the theoretical foundations of a
                   language and a programming methodology for designing
                   parallel algorithms and illustrate the methodology by
                   presenting a concrete program derivation. The goal of
                   the methodology is to define a mapping of a program
                   specification into a concurrent programming language.
                   The methodology is developed in the context of the {\it
                   Unity} formalism. We put special emphasis on derivation
                   of parallel algorithms thar are correct with respect to
                   some high-level program specification. The issue of

                   hidden dependencies between different parts of the
                   system. Modifying clones is not always straight
                   forward, because we might not know all the places that
                   need modification. This is even more of a problem when
                   several developers need to know about how to change the
                   clones. In this paper, we correlate the code clones
                   with the time of the modification and with the
                   developer that performed the modification to detect
                   patterns of how developers copy from one another. We
                   develop a visualization, named Clone Evolution View, to
                   represent the evolution of the duplicated code. We show
                   the relevance of our approach on several large case
                   studies and we distill our experience in forms of
                   interesting copy patterns.},

                   extensible languages for distributed computing. As a
                   sample product of this methodology, which is based on a
                   meta-level (or reflective) technique, this paper
                   describes a variant of C++ called Open C++, in which
                   the programmer can alter the implementation of method
                   calls to obtain new language functionalities suitable
                   for the programmer's applications. This paper also
                   presents a framework called Oc, which is used to help
                   obtain various functionalities for distributed
                   computing on top of Open C++. Because the overhead due
                   to the meta level computation is negligible in
                   distributed computing, this methodology is applicable
                   to practical programming.},

                   beliebigen Umgebung ausf\"uhren zu k\"onnen, muss eine
                   plattformunabh\"angige Zielsprache gesucht werden. Die
                   Plattformunabh\"angigkeit wird dadurch erreicht, dass
                   die Programme nicht auf einer konkreten, sondern auf
                   einer virtuellen Maschine ausgef\"uhrt werden, die als
                   Schnittstelle zwischen compiliertem Code und Plattform
                   dient. Die virtuelle Maschine von Java ("JVM")
                   verarbeitet nicht nur Java, sondern alle Programme, die
                   in einem genau spezifizierten Format dargestellt
                   werden. Beim Compilerbau trennt eine Zwischensprache
                   die Analyse des Quellprogrammes von der Synthese zum
                   Zielprogramm; man kann die beiden Teile unabh\"angig
                   voneinander behandeln. Durch die Verwendung einer
                   Zwischensprache muss nicht jede Quellsprache einzeln in
                   eine bestimmte Zielsprache \"ubersetzt werden, sondern
                   die verschiedenen Analyse-Teile, die Compilerfrontends
                   der Quellsprachen, arbeiten mit einem einzigen
                   Synthese-Teil, dem Compilerbackend f\"ur die
                   Zielsprache zusammen. In dieser Diplomarbeit wird ein
                   Compilerframework aufgebaut, das dank der Zielmaschine
                   JVM plattformunabh\"angig ist, und eine Zwischensprache
                   verwendet, die die Eigenschaften verschiedenartigster
                   Sprachen umfasst. Mittels einer Analyse von
                   Programmiersprachen des imperativen, des
                   objektorientierten, des funktionalen und des logischen
                   Paradigmas werden die Anforderungen an diese generelle
                   Zwischensprache aufgestellt. F\"ur jedes Paradigma wird
                   die Grammatik einer Beispielsprache definiert und ein
                   Parser konstruiert. Diese Parser \"ubersetzen Programme
                   ihrer Quellsprachen in die generelle Zwischensprache.
                   Das Compilerbackend dieser Arbeit generiert aus der
                   generellen Zwischensprache JVM-Code. Der Compiler wird
                   mit Hilfe eines Frameworks konstruiert, indem die
                   Zwischensprache und die Codegenerierung in Klassen mit
                   m\"oglichst genereller Funktionalit\"at aufgeteilt
                   werden. Dadurch k\"onnen sowohl die untersuchten
                   Sprachen, als auch in dieser Arbeit nicht behandelte
                   Programmiersprachen nach JVM Code compiliert werden.},

  abstract       = {Understanding classes and methods is a key activity in
                   object-oriented programming, since classes represent
                   the primary abstractions from which applications are
                   built, while methods contain the actual program logic.
                   The main problem of this task is to quickly grasp the
                   purpose and inner structure of a class. To achieve this
                   goal, one must be able to overview multiple methods at
                   once. In this paper, we present microprints,
                   pixel-based representations of methods enriched with
                   semantical information. We present three specialized
                   microprints each dealing with a specific aspect we want
                   to understand of methods: (1) state access, (2) control
                   flow, and (3) invocation relationship. },

  Title          = {The Roles of Instructions and Examples in learning a
                   Second Language from an Instructional Text: A
                   Computational Model},
  School         = {University of Michigan},
  Type           = {Ph.{D}. Thesis},
  abstract       = {Many second language instructional texts are written
                   in a format in which the learner is presented with an
                   instruction followed by a set of examples. This thesis
                   discusses the roles played by both instruction and
                   examples in learning from such a text and gives
                   functional reasons of why both forms of input are
                   necessary. A computer model of second language
                   learning, called ANT, was built to investigate these
                   roles. Input to the system is similar to what is found
                   in an instructional text. ANT's learning with this
                   input is compared to two alternatives: learning from
                   only examples and learning from only instructions. I
                   discuss why, from a functional or processing
                   standpoint, learning from a mixed input is more
                   effective than either of the alternatives. An empirical
                   comparison was done of ANT's performance on input
                   containing instructions and examples versus performance
                   of the system when given instructions only or examples
                   only. The results of the comparison support the
                   hypothesis as to the utility of mixed input. In
                   addition, a psychological experiment was done with
                   human subjects, the results of which justified the
                   hypotheses of the ANT model. Through the study it was
                   found that the roles instructions play are that they:
                   (1) focus the learner's attention on the nature of the
                   difference between the native and second language; (2)
                   focus the learner's attention on features in the
                   examples relevant to those changes; (3) tell the
                   learner how far the rule can be generalized; (4) allow
                   the learner to alter expectations about the second
                   language input; and (5) tell the learner to which rules
                   the change applies. The roles examples play are that
                   they: (1) help to identify relevant previous knowledge;
                   (2) help to form the new rules; and (3) provide details
                   essential to the rule which are omitted in the
                   instruction. The study also discusses constraints which
                   language learning puts on knowledge representation.},

  abstract       = {While development of a software system is important,
                   it is also very important to have suitable mechanisms
                   for actually deploying code. Current state-of-the-art
                   deployment approaches force the developer to structure
                   the code in such a way that deployment is possible,
                   thereby severely inhibiting reuse and comprehensibility
                   of the system. This paper presents parcels, an atomic
                   deployment mechanism for objects and source code that
                   supports shape changing of classes, method addition,
                   method replacement, and partial loading. The key to
                   making this deployment mechanism feasible and fast is a
                   pickling algorithm that allows the unpickling to be
                   done iteratively instead of with a recursive descent
                   parser. Parcels were developed for VisualWorks
                   Smalltalk, and have been the default deployment
                   mechanism the past years for thousands of customers.},

                   It describes the main features and characteristics that
                   a system must have to qualify as an object-oriented
                   database system. The authors separate these
                   characteristics into three groups: \fIMandatory\fP, the
                   ones the system must satisfy in order to be termed an
                   object-oriented database system. These are complex
                   objects, object identity, encapsulation, types or
                   classes, inheritance, overriding combined with late
                   binding, extensibility, computational completeness,
                   persistence, secondary storage management, concurrency,
                   recovery, and an ad hoc query facility. \fIOptional\fP,
                   the ones that can be added to make the system better,
                   but which are not mandatory. These are multiple
                   inheritance, type checking and inferencing,
                   distribution, design transactions, and versions.
                   \fIOpen\fP, the points where the designer can make a
                   number of choices. These are the programming paradigm,
                   the representation system, the type system, and
                   uniformity. We have taken the position, not so much
                   expecting it to be the final word as to erect a
                   provisional landmark to orient further debate.},

  Journal        = {IEEE Software},
  abstract       = {Nowadays, many complex applications are built with a
                   web browser as their main user interface. However,
                   despite the increasing popularity of the web as an
                   application platform, implementing and maintaining web
                   applications still remains difficult and lags behind
                   conventional desktop application development. The
                   underlying technologies such as HTTP for the
                   interaction and XHTML/CSS for the presentation were
                   originally built to display and link static documents.
                   Unfortunately, most mainstream frameworks provide only
                   little abstraction over the page-oriented structure
                   imposed by those technologies. Inevitably, the
                   goto-like manner of how pages are linked leads to
                   spaghetti code and hampers reuse. In this article we
                   present Seaside, a web application framework that
                   provides an uniform and pure object-oriented view on
                   web applications. In this way, Seaside avoids the
                   unwieldily goto-like style. Exploiting the reflective
                   features of Smalltalk, Seaside reintroduces procedure
                   call abstraction in the client-server context.
                   Seaside's key concepts are: (i) a component
                   architecture supporting multiple, simultaneously active
                   control flows, (ii) a programmatic XHTML generation,
                   and (iii) fully supported on-the-fly debugging,
                   code-editing, and recompilation. In this article we
                   discuss these key features of Seaside and explain how
                   they are made possible by the dynamic nature and the
                   reflective capabilities of Smalltalk.},

                   introduction of many programming languages with
                   different syntax, semantics and/or paradigms has
                   created the need for a consistent interlanguage
                   interoperability support framework. We present a brief
                   overview of the most characteristic interoperability

                   reuse of objects from different programming

  abstract       = {Generic types in programming languages are most often
                   supported with various forms of parametric
                   polymorphism, i.e. functions on types. Within the
                   framework of object-oriented languages, virtual types
                   present an alternative where specific types are derived
                   from generic ones using inheritance rather than
                   function application. While both mechanisms are
                   statically safe and support basic genericity, they have
                   very different typing properties, each of them
                   providing for the description of useful relationships,
                   which are not expressible with the other. In this paper
                   we present, through the use of examples, a mechanism
                   for describing generic classes: structural virtual
                   types. This mechanism is essentially a merger of
                   parameterized classes and virtual types and includes
                   the benefits of both, in particular retaining mutual
                   recursion and covariance of virtual types as well as
                   the function-like nature of parameterized classes.},

                   dass Datenbanksysteme, die nur zur Speicherung von
                   Daten eingesetzt werden, nicht mehr den Anforderungen
                   gen{\"u}gen. Aus diesem Grund werden seit einigen
                   Jahren auf dem Gebiet der Daten- banken Losungen
                   gesucht, um den neuen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
                   Eine m{\"o}gliche Losung bieten aktive
                   Datenbanksysteme. Diese besitzen die Eigenschaft, dass
                   sie auf bestimmte Situationen automatisch reagieren
                   k{\"o}nnen. Ein solches Verhalten wird als aktiv
                   bezeichnet und kann mit Hilfe von Regeln beschrieben
                   werden. In diesen werden die Situationen spezi ziert,
                   die erkannt werden mussen, und Aktionen festgelegt, die
                   beim Eintreten dieser Situationen ausgef{\"u}hrt
                   werden. In diesem Zusammenhang ergeben sich neue
                   Aufgaben, die eine Losung erfordern. So muss festgelegt
                   werden, wie aktives Verhalten mit Hilfe von Regeln
                   realisiert werden kann. Dazu muss spezi ziert werden,
                   wie Regeln in einem ADBS modelliert und verarbeitet
                   werden k{\"o}nnen. Diese Diplomarbeit befasst sich mit
                   der Modellierung, der Analyse sowie der Simulation von
                   Regeln in der aktiven Schicht ALFRED (Active Layer For
                   Rule Execution in Database Systems). Diese Schicht kann
                   auf prinzipiell beliebige konventionelle (passive)
                   Datenbanksysteme aufgesetzt werden und erweitert diese
                   um Funktionalit{\"a}t en, mit denen aktives Verhalten

                   the concept of reflection are useful for modifying
                   programming systems dynamically in a controlled way. To
                   modify the system flexibly, it is necessary to
                   represent various abstraction levels, from the
                   programing language level to the OS level, as well as
                   user's multiple views, such as the view where the
                   distributed environment is transparent and the view
                   where that is not transparent, in a programming system.
                   In traditional reflective systems, it is, however,
                   difficult to represent these aspects of the system
                   because these systems are modeled by one metalevel. To
                   overcome this problem, we have proposed a new
                   reflection framework: Multi-Model Reflection Framework
                   (MMRF), and implemented a programming system AL-1/D
                   based on this framework. This paper gives a clearer
                   definition of MMRF than in our previous paper. MMRF is
                   a framework for decomposing a metalevel into multiple
                   conceptual models according to the abstraction levels
                   and user's views. These conceptual models may overlap
                   each other in their functions and resources. The
                   decomposed models should run concurrently because
                   models represents system components running
                   concurrently in a system. The definition of MMRF
                   includes the conditions to enable models to run

                   from a different perspective, set the relation to other
                   approaches which aim at separating independent concerns
                   into deployable entities, in particular to
                   component-based software development, and discuss the
                   influence of scripting on building applications as
                   assemblies of these entities. Furthermore, we would
                   like to stress the fact that scripting languages do not
                   only allow us to coordinate distributed agents, but
                   also to implement the agents themselves as scripts. },

                   it classes, methods, attributes etc. The affinity
                   between two entities is calculated through the absolute
                   difference of their properties and properties of the
                   dependencies between the two entities; all the
                   properties also have assigned weights. The clustering
                   can be done by a range of clustering algorithms,
                   including hierarchical and partitional algorithms. The
                   result are groups of clusters, that can be examined
                   through their quality metrics and if necessarily
                   improved upon through another clustering run with

                   only to be surpassed by object-oriented technology.
                   With the same motivation component-based solutions are
                   overtaking object-oriented solutions. However, the
                   delegation-only focus of component-based programming
                   risks of resulting in the same problems that
                   modular-based approaches ran into. To counter this, we
                   claim that one of th e important problems that should
                   be addressed by component languages is the composition
                   of components. More specifically, we see component
                   languages where components are black-box abstractions,
                   and with (one or more) composition languages to glue
                   them tog ether. As an example we show a functional
                   (Piccola) and a logic (QSoul) composition approach.},

                   components of the high-level model but also the
                   collaboration within the components improves
                   considerably the value of information the extracted
                   model provides. Our approach extracts dynamic and

                   different levels of collaboration in one single view
                   without loosing the architectural overview of the

                   collaboration-views to strict high-level models based
                   on structural information. Our case studies show that

 abstract = {
   This paper presents DTrace, a new facility for dynamic instrumentation 
   of production systems. DTrace features the ability to dynamically 
   instrument both user-level and kernel-level software in a unified and 
   absolutely safe fashion. When not explicitly enabled, DTrace has zero 
   probe effect - the system operates exactly as if DTrace were not present
   at all. DTrace allows for many tens of thousands of instrumentation points,
   with even the smallest of systems offering on the order of 30,000 such 
   points in the kernel alone. We have developed a C-like high-level control 
   language to describe the predicates and actions at a given point of 
   instrumentation. The language features user-defined variables, including 
   thread-local variables and associative arrays. To eliminate the need for 
   most postprocessing, the facility features a scalable mechanism for 
   aggregating data and a mechanism for speculative tracing. DTrace has been 
   integrated into the Solaris operating system and has been used to find 
   serious systemic performance problems on production systems - problems 
   that could not be found using preexisting facilities.}
