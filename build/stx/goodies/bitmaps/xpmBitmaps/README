These pixmaps were copied from a freeware CD.
I used them as test-data for the xpm-image reader -
you may (or likely will not) find some useful for your applications.

If you want to use one of these icons, we recommend that you load them
into the ImageEditor, and then save it into a METHOD (or into an iconlibrary class).
That assures that your application is independent of any change here and also
makes installation of your class/app easier.

Late note: this has now been done, and file icons are no longer used by ST/X
(i.e. all icons are in the executable, for easier deployment and packaging)
