This directory contains a port of the VisualWorks validating XML parser.

Provided as is - no warranty.

Notice:
there are currently 3 XML parser frameworks available for ST/X:
	indelv,
	yaxo
	vw

The "indelv" parser is provided for historical reasons,
and to maintain backward compatibility for users of this parser.
Consider it as being deprecated.

The yaxo parser is used by the spray soap package which has been ported from dolphin.

New developed programs should use the vw parser.
