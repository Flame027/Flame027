This directory contains the original refactoryBrowsers code
separated into:
    parser
	- scanner, parser and formatter classes 

    changes
	- Change classes

    refactorings
        
    browser
	- the actual browser (i.e. GUI)

    lint
	- smallLint and friends

Changes and refactorings are already used by some other parts
of the system (NewSystemBrowser).

The refactoringBrowser itself is not maintained, although most
of it runs fine.

    However, some known bugs are:
       whenever another tab is added to the RB's notbook view,
       it seems to loose some dependencies and does no longer update
       the codeView ...

    Category (SystemOrganizer) handling is simulated very slow 

Most of the refactoringBrowsers functionality is also found in
the NewSystemBrowser (actually more).

Be reminded:
	this is provided as a goody - no warranty, no maintenance, no nothing.
