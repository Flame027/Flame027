name
        ^ 'Underscore assignments should be avoided (rewrite to ":=")'
!

rationale
        ^ 'The use of the underscore character for 
assignment is a historic leftover from old ST80 times, 
when a back-arrow glyph was shown for that ascii-code.
<P>
Now, an underscore is shown, which makes assignment look ugly.
This rewrites the code to use the modern "<code>:=</code>".'
