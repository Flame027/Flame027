A quick selftest running non-GUI after a jenkins build

to start:
    sh run.sh

or
    run.bat (windows)

executes the tests found in ~/exept/regression/*
and generates a junit-xml compatible output file 'testresult.xml',
(to be consumed by jenkins).

Also some metric info is written to 'metrics.xml'
