[automerge]
# Automatically merge pulled changes from specified mercurial branch (if exists) 
# to specified mercurial branch (if exists). The syntax is 
# 
# automerge = <from-branch>:<to branch>. 
#
# The example below will merge changed from branch `default` to branch `jv`. 
# If merge fails, issue a warning but proceed. Optional. 
#
# automerge = default:jv
automerge = default:jv
#
# If defined and if merge succeeds (there are no unresolved conflicts), 
# check the merged working copy using given command. The command is executed
# with CWD set to repository root. `#{dir}` in the command string will be 
# expanded to actuall repository path. 
# Following commands are built-in: 
# 
# * internal:make - run `make`
#
# A command line option --check overrides this setting. See `hg-automerge --help`.
# 
# checkcmd = internal:make
# checkcmd = internal:make
