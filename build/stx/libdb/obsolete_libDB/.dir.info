Thsi directory contains a preliminary interface
to sql databases, using an ODBC conform interface.
This package is not yet officially released and still
being developed - it is provided without any warranty
(for now).


Currently, only an interface to the msql database is
provided with the system (in ODBCInterfaceMSQL, which maps
ODBC requests to msql calls) - other adaptors will be added
in the furture.
You have to fetch the msql library from somewhere else, since
we cannot provide it with the ST/X distribution for copyright
reasons. However, msql is available through various ftp sites
and also found on various CD distributions. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you want to interface to other databases, take the
ODBCInterfaceMSQL as a guide. If your database already provides
an odbc compliant interface, the mapping from methods to
odbc functions should be almost a 1:1 mapping.

To make:
   change the location of your msql library as required in the
   Make.proto file, remake a makefile ("make mf") and remake
   the database class library ("make"). 
   This should give you a libdb.o / libdb.so, which can be loaded
   into the ST/X executable.


Claus:
   Please excuse this somewhat incomplete and undocumented
   package - yes, I know, we should not publish this in such
   an early state - however, some may find it useful even though
   it is not yet in a stable state (and may crash ...).
