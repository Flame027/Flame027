WORK IN PROGRESS

*******************************************************

The classes here implement a native interface to (parts of) the sqLite library.
You have to download and install a version of the sqlite3.dll before.

This is not strictly needed to work with an sqLite database:
using the sqLite ODBC package (http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc)
you can also access sqLite DBs using the satandard ODBC interface classes
(which also makes your application independent of the concrete type of database you use)
