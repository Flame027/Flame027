This directory (and the resulting shared lib libdb.dll) provide common code
which is independent of the concrete database binding used.
Especially, abstract superclasses to represent statements, tables etc. are found here.

Concrete database interfaces are:
    libodbc   - provides access to the ODBC library, which can be sued to access almost any database
    liboracle - interface to oci8/oci9 native oracle interface

ODBC NOTICE:
    in order to compile libodbc, some system ODBC header files are required.
    Especially: sql.h, sqlext.h and sqltypes.h

    These are usually already present on most machines when the compiler suite is installed.
    So try "locate sql.h" or "find / -name "sql.h" --print"

    A noticable exception is OSX since maverik (again?), where you have to install it first,
    with brew, maybe:
	brew update
        brew install unixodbc

    or else copy the stuff found in "libodbc/iodb_include_for_osx" to "/usr/local/include"
    But be aware: having the include files around only allows for the .st files to be compiled.
    You will still need the .so (shared objects) which make up the odbc library. So better brew a beer.
