Here you'll find interfaces (and libraries) for non-SQL databases.
These are usually superfast and usually do NOT provide an SQL or SQL like interface;
typically, they are key-value oriented.

tokyocabinet: a key/value only database, which is superfast

kyotocabinet: a newer, improved version of tokyocabinet
