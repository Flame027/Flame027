thrift.st was downloaded from github (19-mar-2013):
    https://raw.github.com/twitter/thrift/master/lib/st/thrift.st

thrift.st as downloaded contains a syntax error (readString dublicated);
this was fixed.

cassandra.thrift from appache (also 19-mar-2013):
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk/interface/cassandra.thrift

gen/cassandra.st was generated from thrift with:
    thrift --gen st cassandra.thrift

In a browser, fileIn thrift.st and cassandra.st.
Move the cassandra classes to their package (stx/libdb/nosql/cassandra) and into a separate namespace (Cassandra).

Move the thrift classes to their package (stx/goodies/communication/thrift).
I left the thrift classes in their original namespace (Smalltalk) to avoid
incompatibilities with generated thrift output (which generates Txxx as classnames).

CVS-commit, and update in the directories to get a fileOut format which can be compiled with stc.
(alternatively: fileout to get them classes as individual source files)



Problems with generated cassandra code (thrift translator bugs):

- generates "exception signal" instead of "self raiseException:exception"
  signal in an accessor in VW and ST/X, but a raiser in Squeak.

- generates Exceptions as subclass of Error instead of CassandraError
  (cannot redefined why etc)

- name mangling is for stupid Squeak limitation
