This directory contains even more widgets. These are for demonstration and fun.
They are normally not built into the system.
However, some of them may be nice to polish up your applications;
especially, have a look at ProgressIndicator and ActionWaitBox.

Use of these classes requires that 'libview' and 'libwidg' are
also loaded into the system.

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

	libwidg3.a      - an archive

	libwidg3.obj    - a prelinked object library

	libwidg3.so     - a shared object

If your system supports dynamic object loading, you can filein this
binary classlib with the fileBrowser or by:

	Smalltak fileInClassLibrary:'libwidg3'


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libwidg3

    make objs           compile all required object files
