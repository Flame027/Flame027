This directory contains resource files for the widgets.

The widget classes get their strings from these resource files.
These files are only read during startup.

Notice: starting with ST/X vsn 5.5.1, all resource strings are being
	concentrated into a single catalog (libview/resources/<LANG>.rs)

Notice: in ST/X above vsn 2.10.2, all style relevant stuff has
	been removed from the resource files into separate style
	sheets. Resourcefiles now only contain string translations.
