    ST-80 compatibility class.
    This may be required when existing code has to be ported to ST/X;
    however, it may not be complete and more protocol may be added in the future.
    The code here was created when public domain code (Manchester) had to
    be ported to ST/X and missing classes/methods were encountered, and code added
    by reasoning 'what the original class could probably do there'.
