This directory contains some (mostly functionless) ST-80 compatibility
classes. These may be useful when loading ST-80 code, to have (at least)
a class tree available, where code can be filed into.

It is by no means complete.

Do not expect too much here.






To install them as autoloaded (in the running image):

    make mf
    make updAbbrev
    rdoit "Smalltalk readAbbreviations"
    rdoit "Smalltalk installAutoloadedClasses"
