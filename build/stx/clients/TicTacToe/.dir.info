TicTacToe here is provided as an example to learn something;
(not that I think its too exciting of a game ;-)

For didactic reasons, there are two versions:

	TicTacToe	= an old, all-in-one version

	TicTacToeView
	TicTacToeGame
	TicTacToePlayer = a better structured version, which
			  offers more flexibility
			  (dual display, multiuser version)

The first version is an all-in-one-class version; the second
has separated responsibilities for displaying, managing the game and playing
into three classes.

For the beginner, the second version may be less easy to understand, 
since the connection between model and view are less obvious 
(most is done via change-messages).

Especially for multi-display applications, this example provides a cute 
starting point (someone willing to rewrite xconq in st/x ?).

To start:

    TicTacToe	open		(old version)

    TicTacToeGame open		(new version)
    TicTacToeGame open2UserGame
