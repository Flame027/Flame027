Subdirectories of this directory contain the source
of some applications and demo programs.

(
 the directory name 'clients' is somewhat historic, from times
 when the development system did not exist, and the 'clients' were
 linked, standalone executable X-client programs...
)

Most stuff here is outdated, some programs have been written 20years ago
and not or minimally maintained since then.

There are:

    AddrBook            a simple address & telno application

    Animation           walking man & rotating globes

    Clock               an xclock replacement

    Demos               more small demos
			look for WindowTreeView

    DirView             a finder like directory view

    DocTool             document view, can display RTF files,
			text and images

    DrawTool            a mac-draw like drawing program (nice)

    GLdemos             GL-interface demos for SGI workstations
			and vogl-GL simulator

    LogicTool           digital logic simulation (nice)

    MailTool            another mail reader

    NewsTool            another news reader

    Tetris              have fun
    TicTacToe           have fun

NO WARRANTY
All of these programs are demo clients or goodies.
They are not meant as finished applications, but instead
are to be used as HOW-TO examples.
If any does not work as expected, dont blame the author,
but instead fix the problem and return the fix to cg@ssw.de.

I will try to update and maintain these programs but there is
no guarantee.
