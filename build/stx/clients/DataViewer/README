Real time 3D data visualizer (requires libopengl to be available & loaded).

To load:
	fileIn: loadAll

On the latest ST/X versions, the classes may already be installed as
autoloaded stubs in the TDV namespace. Look there in the browser,
before attempting a fileIn.


To start the sensor-data visualizer:
	TDV::ApplicationColumn3D open

To start the matrix data visualizer:
	TDV::ApplicationMatrix3D open
