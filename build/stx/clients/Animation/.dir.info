Here you find:

	Animation       a walking man

	GlobeDemo       rotating globe

	RoundGlobe      same, with shaped window 
			(if your Xserver / window manager supports them)


All have a middle-button-menu for controls; they also react on
keys:

    'f' - faster
    's' - slower
    'q' - quit
    'h' - halt
    'g' - go

start with:

	Animation start

	GlobeDemo start

	RoundGlobe start

(classes will be autoloaded)

These programs where written before processes have been implemented
in Smalltalk/X. Therefore, they use the timeout-block feature.
They should be rewritten to fork a subprocess for animation.
