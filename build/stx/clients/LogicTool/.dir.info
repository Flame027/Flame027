a Digital Logic simulator (in construction)

Its not finished and might have bugs ....

start with:

       LogicTool open

(will be autoloaded)

Inspired by a similar program I've seen once on a mac.
A nice example for object oriented programming (easy to
add new elements, without changing the view/simulation
classes)

This was written a long time ago (especially before I had
resource files - the dual-language handling is stupid).

todo:
    - add more primitive elements (flip-flops, clock-generators etc)
    - add a library of standard ttl-components
    - simulate exact timing (i.e. have the exact delays (in ns) somewhere
      around, simulate using a priority queue of upcoming changes
    - add logic probes, logic analizer, printout of simulation results etc.
    - and much more

note:
    - use 'simulation start' in the pull-down menu


the bitmaps-subdirectory contains the bitmaps for the gate-icons. 

the _g bitmaps are for germans (europeans ?)
the others are for americans.

The basename is the filename must be the gate-classes name.
(it is constructed from the classname)

NO WARRANTY
This is a demo client or goody. If it works, use it for
your application, subclass it or extract code from it.
If it does not work as expected, fix it and return the
changes to cg@ssw.de. Thanks.
