Some clocks:

        ClockView       a clockView helper class

        Clock           the Clock application

        Clock2          like Clock, but adds an animated icon

        RoundClock      a clock with a round shape

        RoundClock2     like RoundClock, but icon is also round


start with:

        Clock start

        RoundClock start


(classes will be autoloaded)

These programs where written before processes have been implemented
in Smalltalk/X. Therefore, they use the timeout-block feature.
They should be rewritten to fork a subprocess for animation.
