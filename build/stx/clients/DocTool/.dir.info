A quick and dirty viewer for rtf- and image files.
It can also display NeXT mixed format rtf documents with
attachments as for example in NeXTmail (thats what this
was originally written for - before I got my NeXT :-)

Its not at all finished, just a demo ....

start with:

       DocumentView startOn:aFileName

or simply:

        DocumentView start

- and use the 'open' entry in the 'file' menu.


(will be autoloaded)

What needs to be done:
        completely rewrite, using appropriate representation
        of paragraphs. (using DisplayText is a quick hack -
        the fragmentation into one object per word makes
        just too much overhead for even small documents -
        see bad performance when scrolling)

        add editing capabilities

Dont blame me - its just a dumb viewer
