This goody is not yet finished.
It is a first attempt to implement a Color entry dialog.
However, due to its (stupid) implementation, startup time
is way to long, since it tries to allocate many (dithered)
colors. It should be rewritten, to use a smarter color allocation
algorithm.
Beside that, its a nice demo of Sliders and subclasses of Sliders
(with changed viewBackground).

Try:
	ColorPanel new open

or (the individual components):

	ColorWheel new open

	RGBPanel new open

	HLSPanel new open
