a Draw program (90 % finished)

Its not finished and might have bugs ....

start with:

	DrawTool open
or:
	DrawTool openOn:aFilename

(will be autoloaded)

This is a really nice demo and should be finished,
however it is not meant as a product, but as
an example. So accept (or fix) bugs :-)

DrawTool was one of the very first ST/X demo apps;
therefore you may find some code which should be
rewritten for better coding style or to make better use
of functionality which was not available at those old days.

You may think that there is no need for 
'yet another draw program' (and you are definitely
right when saying this). However, many users found
this a good framework to start with when building their
own graphical editor applications. You can either create
your own subclass(es) of ObjectView and copy methods from here.
Or you can subclass DrawView/DrawTool and add/remove 
functionality. One typical application was a Form-editor
to allow users to customize frame and titles in a printed form
sheet - you may find other applications for it.

Also, since the ObjectView is used by many as a
base for their applications, this is also a good
test application for this class.

Things todo:
 - add printing support
 - add better color handling (a color mixer for example)
 - add document import (mac draw, fig etc.)
 - add document output in various formats
 - add more elements (Arcs, Arrows etc)


NO WARRANTY
This is a demo client or goody. If it works, use it for
your application, subclass it or extract code from it.
If it does not work as expected, fix it and return the
changes to cg@ssw.de. Thanks.
