This is a very simple address & telno manager.

Its not finished and might have bugs ....

start with:

       AddressBook start

(will be autoloaded)

it will create & manage a file named '.addr' in your home directory.
To add addresses, fill out the fields, and either type <return> through
the last field. To save the list in the address file, use save from the
top-list-views menu.



There is also an enhanced version,

which needs:

	InitialLabelView.st
	AddressView.st
   and  AddressBook2.st

to be filed in; it is started with:

	AddressBook2 start

(
 it has been built with a version of the interface builder,
 which produces fixed-size fields only - thus it may look
 somewhat strange depending on which fonts are used.
 Its a nice example anyway.

 See the popup menus in the Ort (=City)
 field, which fills in the corresponding zip code into the PLZ (=zip)
 field
)

All of these have to be internationalized - they where created in a
hurry and as a demo ...
