    using a SubCanvas widget, you can start sub applications within
    another application. All resources (i.e. actions, value holders, menus, etc.)
    which are not provided by the subapplication are retrieved from the master 
    application.
    Overwriting or redefining resources is possible. 
    Resources are first searched in the sub application than in the master
    application(s).

    In this example, we are using a value holder, which is set to the
    subapplication to be started - this can be changed dynamically,
    simply by storing a new aplication into the valueHolder.
