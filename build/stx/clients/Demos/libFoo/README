These demo classes allow first experiments in creating
binary class libraries. Read the documentation for more info.

The binary foo library is created by:

   step 1: create a Make.proto (& Makefile from it) with:

	stmkmp	(found in the rules directory)

   step 2: create the libFoo class library:

	make

The resulting binary can either be linked statically to a
new smalltalk exeutable, or loaded dynamically into the 
running system via fileIn.
