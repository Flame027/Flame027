documentation

    using a SubCanvas widget, you can start sub applications within
    another application. All resources (i.e. actions, value holders, menus, etc.)
    which are not provided by the subapplication are retrieved from the master 
    application.
    Overwriting or redefining resources is possible. 
    Resources are first searched in the sub application than in the master
    application(s).

    In this example, we are using a selector which returns the application
    to be started, a selector to access the window specification (optional:
    by default #windowSpec) and the class which provides the window specification
    (optional: by default the application itself is used).
