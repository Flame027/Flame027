    a SubSpecification widget opens a view as specified by an
    interface specification derived from a class and selector.
    The main difference to a  SubCanvas widget is that no new
    application is created. All aspects  and  actions must be 
    implemented in the application.
    SubSpecification can include other Subspecification.
