This directory contains some more (less frequently used) basic classes.
They are included in a standard smalltalk, but can be left out for a 
minitalk or in special (small) final applications.

Compiled by stc into the library 'libbasic2'.

Depending on the configuration and capabilities of your Operating-
System, the resulting classlibrary is either:

	libbasic2.a      - an archive

	libbasic2.obj    - a prelinked object library

	libbasic2.so     - a shared object

the library includes init code (libbasic2_Init) for all of its components.


Things you can do here:

    make                compile all classes, producing libbasic2

    make objs           compile object files

    make install        compile all and install in DESTLIBDIR

    make qinstall       only install - assumes binaries are up-to-date 

    make check          syntax check only over all .st files

    make <file>.o       compile <file>.st to object-file

    make <file>.c       compile <file>.st to c intermediate

    make clean

    make clobber
